# What's new

## VERSION 0.4

### version 0.4.0rc1

#### NEW FEATURES

##### NetCDF import/export
Features related to the export and import format (see [issue #97- comment](
https://github.com/spectrochempy/spectrochempy/issues/97#issuecomment-639590022))

* `write_netcdf`: Write to file in [netCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) format.
* This type of file is a binary file format for self-described datasets
  that originated in the geosciences. It is not much in chemistry (as far we know) but it is used by xarray as a
  recommended way of saving data.
  Also saving spectrochempy file in this format will allow an easy interchange between the two software.
  (Saving on this format is only possible if [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package is available).

* `NDDataset.to_xarray`: A new dataset method creating a `xarray.DataArray` object suitable for use with `xarray`.

* `read_netcdf` : open netCDF files saved by spectrochempy or xarray (not tested with other sources).

* `NDDataset.from_xarray`: Create a new dataset from a `xarray.DataArray` object.

* refactoring related to the export to netCDF.

    Note the renaming of three attributes
    have been made to improve conversion from and to xarray.

    - title --> long_name
    - origin --> source
    - description --> comment

    Backwards compatibility is preserved in reading

##### Timezone info

* A new attribute allows the user to change the timezone of the dataset. This affect the way
  attributes such are `created` are displayed. Internally stored in UTC format, they are display according to the timezone info.

##### Datetime coordinates

* Coordinates can now be created with the numpy dtype  'datetime64'. Internally all datetimes will be stored in UTC.
  When reading a date or a datetime coordinates the return will be converted to the local timezone, except if the
  timezone property of the dataset is set differently.

#### Other changes

* History
  Its behavior have been improved.
  Dates for entries are set automatically and are timezone-aware.
  See the docs for more information:
[About-the-history-attribute](https://www.spectrochempy.fr/latest/userguide/dataset/dataset.html#About-the-history-attribute)

* Datetime64 coordinates of NDDataset.

    np.datetime64 numpy array can be used a coordinate transparently.  Regaring the math operation on such axis, only addtion or substraction are allowed.

* reading of metadata simplified:

```python
nd2 = IR_dataset_2D

# add some attribute
nd2.meta.pressure = 34
nd2.meta.temperature = 3000
assert nd2.meta.temperature == 3000
assert nd2.temperature == 3000 # alternative way to get the meta attribute

# also for the coordinates
nd2.y.meta.pression = 3
assert nd2.y.meta["pressure"] == 3
assert nd2.y.pressure == 3  # alternative way to get the meta attribute
```
* Change the size of rotating log to 256K instead of 32K.

* Revision of the math operations :
  This function is at the heart of the mathematical calculations on the
  data sets and coordinates. However the complexity of its structure made
  it very difficult to maintain and debug. Thus, an
  important rewrite of this function has been performed in order to make
  it more understandable and therefore easier to maintain.
* Integration method are now located with the analysis methods
* Datetime axis now taken into account in plot methods.
* Datetime best units estimated automatically

#### BUGS FIXED

* Coordinate _sort method
* Add m and magnitude (properties)
  They are Alias of data but the previous definition was not working.
* Revision of some testing methods : comparison of multicoordinates now works.
* NDDataset/NDArray.squeeze() and  add test for this method.
  It was failing when *dim argument were passed.
  In addition Ia new argument keepdims has been added to define dimension
  to keep even if they are of size 1.
* Update iris.py to avoid muticoordinate's names change.
  Multicoordinates work bad for name indexing if their name is not _1, _2 ...
* Missing case in check_filename_to_save.
* Bug for math operation on LinearCoordinates: unit loss
  The integrate method so it takes into account Datetime64 axis.
* math _op method for LinearCoord.
* inplace binary methods to work with datetime64 coordinates.
* Copy method of Coord now copy the size attribute.
* display problem in PCA examples.
* Docs display problems for twinx (both axes are now unit-aware)
