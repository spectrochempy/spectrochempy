SpectroChemPy API Module.

SpectroChemPy is a framework for processing, analyzing and modeling Spectroscopic data
for Chemistry with Python. It is a cross-platform software, running on Linux, Windows or OS X.

This module serves as the main entry point for the SpectroChemPy package, providing:
- Configuration of warning filters
- Import of the public API
- Dynamic attribute access to NDDataset methods

    Dynamic attribute lookup for NDDataset methods.

    This function allows direct access to NDDataset methods from the top-level package.
    For example, `spectrochempy.method_name` will return the corresponding method
    from NDDataset if it exists.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the attribute to look up

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        The requested NDDataset method
