# # Peak finding, part 1: maxima
#
# This tutorial shows how to find peaks and determine peak maxima with spectrochempy. As prerequisite, the user is
# expected to have read the [Import](../IO/import.ipynb), [Import IR](../IO/importIR.ipynb),
# [slicing](../processing/slicing.ipynb) tutorials. First lets import the modules that will be used in this tutorial:

# %%
import spectrochempy as scp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # will be used for some plots

# %% [markdown]
# Second, import and plot a typical IR dataset (CO adsorption on supported CoMo catalyst in the 2300-1900 cm-1 region)
# that will be used throughout:

# %%
X = scp.read_omnic('irdata/CO@Mo_Al2O3.SPG')[:, 2300.:1900.]

# %% [markdown]
# ## 1 Find maxima by manual inspection of the plot
#
# The use of the "magic command" `%matplotlib widget` in a notebook triggers the plotting of interactive plots
# integrated in the notebook with basic tools to navigate inside the plot. As shown below from top to bottom of the
# side bar:
# - hide/show the tools,
# - reset view ('home'),
# - previous view ('left arrow'),
# - next view ('right arrow),
# - move ('arrow cross'),
# - zoom ('rectangle'),
# - save image ('floppy disc').
#
# Another possibility is to use `%matplotlib qt` instead. In this case, the plot is generated
#
# In this interactive mode, the current abscissa and ordinates are indicated when the mouse pointer is displaced in
# the plot area.

# %%
# %matplotlib widget
ax = X.plot(cmap='Dark2')

# %% Once a given maximum has been approximately located manually with the mouse, it is possible to obtain [markdown]
# For instance, after zooming on the highest peak of the last spectrum,
# one finds that it is locate at ~ 2115.5 cm$^{-1}$. The exact coordinate can the be obtained using the following code
# (see the [slicing tutorial](../processing/slicing.ipynb) for more info):

# %%
# X.x[2115.5] returns a Coord object of 1 element, its data attribute is a ndarray which first (and only) element
# is indexed '0':
X.x[2115.5].data[0]

# %% [markdown]
# The value of the absorbance can be also obtained using:

# %%
X[-1, 2115.5].data[0, 0]

# %% ### Note: on Magics Technically, a "magic command", invoked by the % sign, controls the behaviour of [markdown]
# #### Note on "magics"
# A 'magic command' introduced with the % sign  are enhancements added over the normal python code. In the
# present case (`%matplotlib widget`), a particular matplotlib backend is triggered *once and
# for all in the current ipython session*. The only way to change it back to the previous one (`%matplotlib inline`
# which is the default) requires restarting the Ipython Kernel in the menu of Jupyter.
#
# Another useful "magic" for interactive plots is `%matplotlib qt` (also definitive in the current session),
# which will generate interactive plots in separate and independant windows, which is usually faster and more fluid,
# in particular for complex plots.

# ## 2 find maxima with an automated method: `find_peaks()`
#
# Exploring the spectra manually is useful, but cannot be made systematically in large datasets with many - possibly
# shifting peaks. The maxima of a given spectrum can be found automatically by the find_peaks() method which is based
# on [scpy.signal.find_peaks()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html).
# It returns two outputs: `peaks` a NDDataset grouping the peak maxima (wavenumbers and absorbances) and `properties`
# a dictionary containing properties of the returned peaks (it is empty if no particular option is selected,
# see section 2.3. for more information).
#
# ###  2.1. default behaviour
# Applying this method on the last spectrum without any option will yield 7 peaks :

# %%
peaks, properties = X[-1].find_peaks()  # apply find peaks
peaks.x  # "peaks" is a NDDataset. Its x Coord gives the peak position

# %% [markdown]
# The code below shows how the peaks found by this method can be marked:

# %%
X.plot(cmap='Dark2')
for peak in peaks:  # loop over peaks
    plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data.T, 'v',
             color='black')  # the data field must be transposed for plot; 'v' is the triangle_down marker

# %% [markdown]
# and for the whole dataset:

# %%
X.plot(cmap='Dark2')
for s in X:  # loop over rows (= spectra)
    peaks, prop = s.find_peaks()  # find peaks

    for peak in peaks:  # loop over peaks
        plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data.T, 'v', color='black')

# %% [markdown]
# It should be noted that this method finds only true maxima, not shoulders (!). For the detection of such underlying
# peaks, the use of methods based on derivatives or advanced detection methods - which will be treated in separate
# tutorial - are required. Once ther maxima of a given peak have been found, it is possible, for instance,
# to plot its evolution with, e.g. the time. For instance for the peaks located at 2220-2180 cm$^{-1}$:

# %%
maxwn = []  # empty list, will contain wavenumbers at the maximum
for s in X:  # loop over  spectra
    peak, prop = s[:, 2220.:2180.].find_peaks()  # find peak
    maxwn.append(peak.x.data[0])  # append the wavenumber

time = (X.y - X.y[0]).to("minute").data  # return a ndarray of time in minutes, relative to the 1st spectrum

plt.figure()  # classic instructions for a xy plot in matplotlib.
plt.plot(time, maxwn, 'o-')
plt.xlabel("acquisition time / min")
plt.ylabel("wavenumber at maximum / cm$^{-1}$")


# %% [markdown]
# ###  2.2. Options of `find_peaks()`
#
# The default behaviour of find_peaks() will return *all* the detected maxima. The user can choose various options to
# select among these peaks:
#
# **Parameters relative to "peak intensity":**
# - `height`: minimal required height of the peaks (single number) or minimal and maximal heights
# (sequence of two numbers)
# - `prominence`: minimal prominence of the peak to be detected
# (single number) or minimal and maximal prominence (sequence of 2 numbers). In brief the "prominence" of a peak
# measures how much a peak stands out from its surrounding and is the vertical distance between the peak and its
# lowest "contour line". It should not be confused with the height as a peak can have an important height but a small
# prominence when surronded by other peaks (see below for an illustration).
#     - in addition to the prominence, the user can define `wlen`, the width (in points) of the window used to look
#     at neighboring minima, the peak maximum being is at the center of the window.
# - `threshold`: a single number (the minimal required threshold) or a sequence of two numbers (minimal and maximal).
# The thresholds are the difference of height of the
# maximum with its two neighboring points (useful to detect spikes for instance)
#
# **Parameters relative to "peak spacing":**
# - `distance`: the required minimal horizontal distance between neighbouring peaks. Smaller peaks are removed first.
# - `width`: Required minimal width of peaks in samples (single number) or minimal and maximal width. The width is
# assessed from the peak height,
# prominence and neighboring signal. - In addition the user can define `rel_height` (a float between 0. and 1. used
# to compute the width - see the [scipy documentation](
# https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.peak_widths.html)  for further details.
# - Finally we mention en passant a last parameter, `plateau_size()` used for selecting peaks having truly flat tops (
# as in e.g. square-boxed signals).
#
# The use of some of these options for the last spectrum of the dataset is examplified in the following:

# %%
s = X[-1]

# default settings
peaks, properties = s.find_peaks()
s.plot()
for peak in peaks:
    plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data.T, 'v', color='black')

# find peaks heights than 0.05  (NB: the spectra are shifted for the display.
# Refer to the 1st spectrum for true heights)
peaks, properties = s.find_peaks(height=0.05)
(s + 0.05).plot(clear=False)
for peak in peaks:
    plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data.T + 0.05, 'v', color='blue')

# find peaks heights between 0.05 and 0.2 (the highest peak won't be detected)
peaks, properties = s.find_peaks(height=(0.05, 0.2))
(s + 0.1).plot(clear=False)
for peak in peaks:
    plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data.T + 0.1, 'v', color='red')

# find peaks with prominence >= 0.05 (only the two most prominent peaks are detected)
peaks, properties = s.find_peaks(prominence=0.05)
(s + 0.15).plot(clear=False)
for peak in peaks:
    plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data.T + 0.15, 'v', color='purple')

# find peaks with distance >= 10 (only tht highest of the two maxima at ~ 2075 is detected)
peaks, properties = s.find_peaks(distance=10)
(s + 0.20).plot(clear=False)
for peak in peaks:
    plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data.T + 0.20, 'v', color='green')

# find peaks with width >= 10 (none of the two maxima at ~ 2075 is detected)
peaks, properties = s.find_peaks(width=10)
(s + 0.25).plot(clear=False)
for peak in peaks:
    plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data.T + 0.25, 'v', color='grey')

# %% [markdown]
# ### 2.3 More on peak properties
#
# If the concept of "peak height" is pretty clear, it is worth examining further some peak properties as defined and
# used in `find_peaks()`. They can be obtained (and used) by passing the parameters `height`, `prominence`,
# `threshold`  and `width`. Then `find_peaks()` will return the corresponding properties of the detected peaks in the
# `properties` dictionary.
#
# #### Prominence
#
# The prominence of a peak can be defined as the vertical distance from the peakâ€™s maximum to the *lowest horizontal
# line passing through a minimum but not containing any higher peak*. This is illustrated below for the three most
# prominent peaks of the above spectra:
#
# <img src="figures/prominence.png" alt="prominence_def" width="350" align="center" />
#
# Let's illustrate this for the second highest peak which height is comprised between ~ 0.15 and 0.22 and see which
# properties are returned when, on top of `height`, we pass `prominence=0`: this will return the properties
# associated to the prominence and warrant that this peak will not be rejected on the prominence criterion.

# %%
peaks, properties = s.find_peaks(height=(0.15, 0.22), prominence=0)
properties

# %% The actual prominence of the peak is this 0.0689, a value significantly lower that is peak height ( [markdown]
# The peak prominence is 0.0689, a much lower value than the height (0.1995), as could be expected by the illustration
# above.
#
# The algorithm used to determine the left and right 'bases' is illustrated below:
# - (1) extend a line to the left and right of the maximum until until it reaches the window border (here on
# the left) or the signal (here on the right.
# - (2) find the minimum value within the intervals defined above. These
# points are the peak's bases.
# - (3) use the higher base (here the right base) and peak maximum to calculate the
# prominence.
#
# <img src="figures/prominence_algo.png" alt="prominence_algo" width="350" align="center" />
#
# The following code shows how to plot the maximum and the two "base points" from the previous output of `find_peaks()`:

# %%
ax = s.plot()
plt.plot(peaks.x, peaks.data[0, 0], 'v', color='green')  # plots the  maximum
wl, wr = properties['left_bases'][0], properties['right_bases'][0]  # wavenumbres of of left and right bases
for w in (wl, wr):
    plt.axvline(w, linestyle='--')  # add vertical line at the bases
    plt.plot(w, s[0, w].T, 'v', color='red')  # and a red mark
ax = ax.set_xlim(2310.0, 1900.0)  # change x limits to better see the 'left_base'

# %% It leads to base marks at their expected locations. We can further check that the prominence of the [markdown]
# We can check that the correct value of the peak prominence is obtained by the difference between its height
# and the highest base, here the 'right_base':

# %%
print("calc. prominence={:f}".format((peaks - s[:, wr]).data[0, 0]))

# %% Finally, we illustrate how the use of the `wlen` parameter - which limits the search of the "base [markdown]
# Finally, the figure below shows how the prominence can be affected by `wlen`, the size of the window used to
#  determine the peaks' bases.
#
# <img src="figures/prominence_wlen.png" alt="prominence_def" width="700" align="center" />
#
# As illustrated above a reduction of the window should reduce the prominence of the peak. This impact can be checked
# with the code below:

# %%
peak, prop = s.find_peaks(height=0.2, prominence=0)
print("prominence with full spectrum: {:f}".format(prop['prominences'][0]))

peak, prop = s.find_peaks(height=0.2, prominence=0,
                          wlen=50.0)  # a float should be explicitely passed, else will be considered as points
print("prominence with reduced window: {:f}".format(prop['prominences'][0]))

# %% [markdown]
# #### Width

# %% The peak widths, as returned by `find_peaks()` can be *very approximate* and for precise assessment, [markdown]
# The find_peaks() method also returns the peak widths. As we will see below, the method is **very approximate** and
# more advanced methods (such as peak fitting, also implemented in spectrochempy - see [this example]
# (https://www.spectrochempy.fr/dev/gallery/auto_examples/fitting/plot_fit.html#sphx-glr-gallery-auto-examples-fitting
# -plot-fit-py) should be used. On the other hand, **the magnitude of the width is generally fine**.
#
# This estimate is based on an algorithm similar to that used for the "bases" above, except that the horizontal
# line starts from a `width_height` computed from the peak height subtracted by a *fraction* of the peak prominence
# defined bay `rel_height` (default = 0.5). The algorithm is illustrated below for the two most prominent peaks:
#
# <img src="figures/width_algo.jpg" alt="width_algo" width="900" align="center" />
#
# When the `width` keyword is used, `properties` disctionarry returns the prominence parameters (as it is used for
# the calculation of the width), the width and the left and right interpolated positions ("ips") of the intersection
# of the horizontal line with the spectrum:

# %%
peak, prop = s.find_peaks(height=0.2, width=0)
prop

# %% The code below shows how these heights and widths can be extracted from the dictionary and plotted [markdown]
# The code below shows howe these data can be extracted and then plotted using the matplotlib library:

# %%
# extraction of data (for better readbility pof the code below)
height = prop['peak_heights'][0]
width_height = prop['width_heights'][0]
wl = prop['left_ips'][0]
wr = prop['right_ips'][0]

s.plot()
plt.axhline(height, linestyle='--', color='blue')
plt.axhline(width_height, linestyle='--', color='red')
plt.axvline(wl, linestyle='--', color='green')
plt.axvline(wr, linestyle='--', color='green')

# %% As stressed above, we see here that the peak width is very approximate and probably exaggerated in [markdown]
# It is obvious here that the peak width is overestimated in the present case due to the presence of the second peak on
# the left. Here a better estimate would be obtained by considering the right half-width, or reducing the `rel_height`
# parameter as shown below.

# ### 2.4 A code snippet to display properties
#
# The self-contained code snippet below can be used to display in a matplolib plot and print the various
# peak properties of a single peak as returned by `find_peaks()`:

# peak selection parameters; should be set to return a single peak

width = 0.0  # minimal width or min and max widths
threshold = None  # minimal threshold or min and max threshold)

# prominence and width parameter
wlen = None  # the length of the window used to compute the prominence
rel_height = 0.47  # the fraction of the prominence used to compute the width

# code: find peaks, plot and print properties -------------------
peak, prop = s.find_peaks(height=height, prominence=prominence, wlen=wlen,
                          threshold=threshold, width=width, rel_height=rel_height)
s.plot()
plt.plot(peak.x, peak.data[0, 0], 'v', color='blue')
for w in (prop['left_bases'][0], prop['right_bases'][0]):
    plt.plot(w, s[0, w].data.T, 'v', color='red')
for w in (prop['left_ips'][0], prop['right_ips'][0]):
    plt.axvline(w, linestyle='--', color='green')

print('{:>16}: {:<8.4f}'.format("peak_maximum", peak.x.data[0]))
for key in prop:
