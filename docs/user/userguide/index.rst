Introduction
############

The |scpy| project was developed to provide advanced tools for processing and
analyzing spectroscopic data, initially for internal purposes in the
`LCS <https://www.lcs.ensicaen.fr/>`_.

Scpy is essentially a library written in python language and which proposes objects (NDDataset, NDPanel and Project)
to contain data, equipped with methods to analyze, transform or display this data in a simple way by the user.

The processed data are mainly spectroscopic data from techniques such as IR, Raman or NMR, but they are not limited
to this type of application, as any type of numerical data arranged in tabular form can generally serve as the main
input.


How to get started
******************

**Note** We assume that the SpectroChemPy package has been correctly
installed. if is not the case, please go to `SpectroChemPy installation
procedure <../../gettingstarted/install/index.rst>`__


Working with Jupyter notebooks
-------------------------------

Currently **SpectroChemPy** can be used as a library for python scripts.

For ease of use, we recommend using the
`JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html>`__
application or for those who are more comfortable with programming,
writing python scripts in a development environment such as
`PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/pycharm/>`__, `VS
Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`__ or
`Spyder <https://www.spyder-ide.org>`__.


Using ``Jupyter Lab``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a terminal and issue the following commands:

Go to your favorite user document folder (*e.g.,* \`$HOME/workspace/) or
any other folder you want to use to store your work).

.. code:: bash

   $ cd ~/workspace
   $ jupyter lab

Your default browser should now be open, and the window should look like
this:

From there, it is quite easy to create notebooks or to navigate to
already existing ones.


Using the application in a web browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: alert alert-info

      <center>In progress</center>

For the moment we donâ€™t yet have a graphical interface to offer other
than Jupyter notebooks or python scripts. It is in any case our
preferred way of working with SpectroChemPy because it offers all the
necessary flexibility for a fast and above all reproducible realization
of the different tasks to be performed on spectroscopic data.

However we have started to create a simple interface using Dash which
will allow in a future version to work perhaps more simply for those who
do not have the time or the will to learn to master the rudiments of
python or who do not wish to program.
