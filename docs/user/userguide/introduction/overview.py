# ## How to get started

# %% [markdown]
# **Note**
# We assume that the SpectroChemPy package has been correctly installed. if is not the case, please go to
# [SpectroChemPy installation procedure](../../../gettingstarted/install/index.rst)

# ### Working with Jupyter notebooks

# %% [markdown]
# Currently **SpectroChemPy** can be used as a library for python scripts.
#
# For ease of use, we recommend using the [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) application or for those who are more comfortable with programming, writing python scripts in a development environment such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/pycharm/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org).

# #### Using `Jupyter Lab`
#
# Open a terminal and issue the following commands:
#
# Go to your favorite user document folder (*e.g.,* `$HOME/workspace/) or
# any other folder you want to use to store your work).
#
# ```bash
# $ cd ~/workspace
# $ jupyter lab
# ```
#
# Your default browser should now be open, and the window should look like this:
#
# <img src="../images/jupyter_lab_home.png" alt="launch" width="690"/>
#
# From there, it is quite easy to create notebooks or to navigate to already existing ones.

# ### Using the application in a web browser

#
# For the moment we don't yet have a graphical interface to offer other than Jupyter notebooks or python scripts. It is in any case our preferred way of working with SpectroChemPy because it offers all the necessary flexibility for a fast and above all reproducible realization of the different tasks to be performed on spectroscopic data.  
#
# However we have started to create a simple interface using Dash which will allow in a future version to work perhaps more simply for those who do not have the time or the will to learn to master the rudiments of python or who do not wish to program.
