Developper's guide
===================


Every SpectroChemPy user can make a useful contribution to this project.

There are several ways to do so, depending on your programming knowledge and/or availability:

* report bugs
* request improvements or new features

These are minimal contributions, but they would help us so much to maintain a functional application
(see :ref:`contributing.bug_reports`).

In this WIKI, we will also talk about more advanced topics concerning contributions such as:

* contribute to the documentation
* writing tutorials
* contribute to the code
* ...
