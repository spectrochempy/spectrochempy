# ## Denoising 2D spectra
# Denoising 2D spectra can be done using the above filtering techniques which can be applied sequentially
# to each rows of a 2D dataset.
#
# e.g., let's take a series of Raman spectra for demonstration: These spectra present both a significant noise and cosmic rays spikes.

# %%
# Load the data  ( )
dataset = scp.read("ramandata/labspec/serie190214-1.txt")
# select the useful region (in particular spectra are 0 after 6500 s)
nd = dataset[0.0:6500.0, 70.0:]
# baseline correction the data (for a easier comparison)
nd1 = nd.snip()
# plot
prefs = nd1.preferences
prefs.figure.figsize = (9, 5)
_ = nd1.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# We can apply a Savgol filter to denoise the spectra

# %%
nd2 = nd1.savgol(size=7, order=2)
_ = nd2.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# The problem is that, not only the spikes are not removed, but they are also broadened.

# %% [markdown]
# A better way to simply denoise this spectra is to use the `denoise` dataset method.
#
# The ratio parameter fix the amount of variance we want to preserve in % (default 99.8%)

# %%
nd3 = nd1.denoise(ratio=90)
_ = nd3.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# This clearly help to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
# However, it apparently has in the present case a poor effect on eliminating cosmic ray peaks.

# ## Removing cosmic rays spike from Raman spectra

# ### Median filter

# %% [markdown]
# A first way to perform this is to apply a median-filter to the data

# %%
filter = scp.Filter(method="median", size=5)
nd4 = filter(nd1)
_ = nd4.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# However, the spike are not fully removed, and are broadened.

# %% [markdown]
# ### `despike` method
#
# To obtain better results, one can use the despike methods. The default method ('katsumo') is based on
# :cite:t:`katsumoto:2003`. The second one ('whitaker') is based on :cite:t:`Whitaker:2018`
# For both methods, only two parameters needs to be tuned: `delta`, a threshold for the detection of spikes, and
# `size` the size of the window to consider around the spike to estimate the original intensity.

# %%
X = nd1[0]
nd5 = scp.despike(X, size=11, delta=5)
_ = X.plot()
_ = nd5.plot(clear=False, ls="-", c="r")

# %% [markdown]
# Getting the desired results require the tuning of size and delta parameters. And sometimes may need to repeat the procedure on a previously filtered spectra.
#
# For example, it size or delta are badly chosen, valid peaks could be removed. So careful inspection of the results is crucial.

# %%
nd5b = scp.despike(X, size=21, delta=2)
_ = X.plot()
_ = nd5b.plot(clear=False, ls="-", c="r")

# %% [markdown]
# Last we can apply it to the full 2D dataset

# %%
nd6 = scp.despike(nd1, size=11, delta=5)
_ = nd6.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# It is however rarely perfect as the setting of size and delta may be depending on the row.
#
# A possibility to improve it is to apply a denoise filter afterward.

# %%
nd7 = nd6.denoise(ratio=92)
_ = nd7.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# The 'whitaker' method is also available:
# %%
nd8 = scp.despike(nd1, size=11, delta=5, method="whitaker")
_ = nd8.plot()
