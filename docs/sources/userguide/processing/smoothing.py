# # Filtering, Smoothing and Denoising
#
# In this tutorial, we show how to filter/smooth 1D and 2D spectra and gives information
# on the algorithms used in Spectrochempy.
#
# We first import spectrochempy, the other libraries used in this tutorial, and a sample
# raman dataset:

# %%
import spectrochempy as scp
from spectrochempy import info_

# %% [markdown]
# First, we import a sample raman spectrum:

# %%
# use the generic read function. Note that read_labspec would be equivalent for this file format.
X = scp.read("ramandata/labspec/SMC1-Initial_RT.txt")

# %% [markdown]
# and plot it:

# %%
# Use preferences to set the figure size for all figures
prefs = X.preferences
prefs.figure.figsize = (8, 4)

# and use plot method of the NDDataset
_ = X.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# To have a better view of the filters effect, we will zoom on a smaller region:
# (0,400) cm$^{-1}$ and we will add some additional noise.

# %%
# select a region by slicing (note the original shape is (1, 1024)
Xs = X[:, 0.0:400.0]
info_("shape: ", X.shape)
_ = Xs.plot()

# %%
import numpy as np

noise = np.random.normal(0, 100, 215)
Xn = Xs + noise
_ = Xn.plot()

# ## The `Filter` processor
#
# The `Filter` processor is a generic processor which can be used to filter 1D and 2D
# spectra.
#
# Here is a demonstration on how to use it to smooth a 1D spectrum.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Moving average
#
# In its simplest form of smoothing is a unweighted moving average - each absorbance at
# a given wavenumber of the smoothed spectrum is the average of the absorbance at the
# absorbance at the considered wavenumber and the N neighboring wavenumbers
# (i.e. N/2 before and N/2 after), hence the conventional use of an odd number of
# N+1 points to define the window length. For the points located at both end of the
# spectra, the extremities of the spectrum are mirrored beyond the initial limits to
# minimize boundary effects.
#
#
# Let's create a filter processor with a moving average (method `avg`) of 3 points
# (default size is 5).

# %%
filter = scp.Filter(method="avg", size=5)

# %% [markdown]
# Apply the filter to the spectrum Xn

# %%
Xsm = filter.transform(Xn)

# %% [markdown]
# Note that the above syntax can be simplified to the equivalent:

# %%
Xsm = filter(Xn)

# %% [markdown]
# Now, let's plot the result.
#
# However, as this will be repeated along the tutorial, we first make a function to plot
# both original and transformed spectra on the same figure, with a legend.


# %%
def plot(X, Xm, label=None, xlim=None):
    X.plot(color="b", label="original")
    ax = Xm.plot(clear=False, color="r", ls="-", lw=1.5, label=label)
    diff = X - Xm
    s = round(diff.std(dim=-1).values, 2)
    ax = diff.plot(clear=False, ls="-", lw=1, label=f"difference (std={s})")
    ax.legend(loc="best", fontsize=10)
    if xlim is not None:
        ax.set_xlim(xlim)
    scp.show()


# %%
plot(Xn, Xsm, label="Moving average (5 points)")


# %% [markdown]
# ### Convolution with window filters
#
# These filters are based on the convolution of scaled window, with the signal.
# For instance the `han` convolution method use a `han` (also known as 'hanning')
# window.


# %%
filter = scp.Filter(
    method="han", size=7
)  # can also be one of 'hamming', 'bartlett', # 'blackman'.
Xhan = filter(Xn)
plot(Xn, Xhan, label="Hanning filter (7 points)")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Savitzky-Golay filter
#
# The `Filter` processor can also be used to apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to the
# spectrum.
#
# This algorithm uses a polynomial interpolation in the moving window. A demonstrative
# illustration of the method can be found on the Savitzky-Golay filter entry of
# Wikipedia.
#
# The function implemented in spectrochempy is a wrapper of the savgol_filter() method
# from the scipy.signal module to which we refer the interested reader. It not only
# used to smooth spectra but also to compute their successive derivatives. The latter
# are treated in the peak-finding tutorial and we will focus here on the smoothing
# which is the default of the filter (default parameter: deriv=0 ).
#
# As for the previous kernel-based filters, it is a moving-window based method. Hence,
# the window length (`size` parameter) plays an equivalent role. Moreover,
# instead of choosing a window function, the user can choose the order of the
# polynomial used to fit the window data points (`order` , default value: 0).
# The latter must be strictly smaller than the window size (so that the polynomial
# coefficients can be fully determined).

# %%
filter = scp.Filter(
    method="savgol", size=5, order=0
)  # default is size=5, order=2, deriv=0
Xsgs = filter(Xn)
plot(Xn, Xsgs, label="Savitzky-Golay (5 points, order=0)")

# %% [markdown]
# As the `order` is set to 0, there is no much difference compared to a simple moving
# average.


# %% [markdown]
# Now we can try to increase the polynomial order to 2 to see the effect on the
# smoothing.


# %%
filter.order = 2
filter.size = 7
Xsm2 = filter(Xn)
plot(Xn, Xsm2, label="Savitzky-Golay (7 points, order=2)")


# %% [markdown]
# ### Whittaker-Eilers filter
#
# As good alternative to the Savitzky-Golay filter want can choose to use the
# Whittaker-Eilers smoother described in:
# P. H. C. Eilers, "A perfect smoother", Anal. Chem. 2003, 75, 3631-3636.
# The implementation in SpectroChemPy is based on the work by H. V. Werts
# (https://github.com/mhvwerts/whittaker-eilers-smoother). The main parameter to be
# changed is the `lamb` ('Î»' in the Eilers paper), which determines the strength
# of the smoothing. Note that it may needs tuning over several orders of
# magnitude (1, 10, 100, 1000, ...).

# %%
filter = scp.Filter(method="whittaker", order=2, lamb=1.5)
Xwhit = filter(Xn)
plot(Xn, Xwhit, label="Whittaker-Eilers (order=2, lamb=1.5)")


# %% [markdown]
# ## Filtering using API or NDDataset methods.
#
# In addition to the `Filter` processor which provide an uniform interface to the
# various filter methods provided by
# SpectroChemPy, it is also possible (as in previous version of spectrochempy)
# to use specific NDDataset methods or API functions.
#
# Let's demonstrate this here.
#
# ### The `smooth` method

# %% [markdown]
# When simply used as this, i.e. `X.smooth()` , the method uses a default
# moving average ('avg') of 5 points:

# %%
Xsm = Xn.smooth()  # NDDataset method

# %% [markdown]
# Note that it is also possible to use the API function `scp.smooth(X)` instead of the
# dataset method `X.smooth()`. The result
# is the same.

# %%
Xsm = scp.smooth(Xn)  # SpectroChemPy API function

# %% [markdown]
# #### Window size influence
#
# The following code compares the influence of the window size on the smoothing of
# the `Xn` NDDataset.

# %%
for size in [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]:
    Xsm = Xn.smooth(size)
    plot(Xn, Xsm, label=f"smooth `avg` size={size}")


# %% [markdown]
# The above spectra clearly show that for large value of the `size` parameter,
# the spectrum is flattened out and distorted.
#
# When determining the optimum window size, one should thus consider
# the balance between noise removal and signal integrity: the larger the window size,
# the stronger the smoothing,
# but also the greater the chance to distort the spectrum.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Convolution with windows
#
# Besides the window `size`, the user can also choose the type of
# window (`window` ) from `flat`(eq. to `avg`) , `han` , `hamming` ,
# `bartlett` or `blackman` .
# The `flat` window - which is the default shown above - should be fine for the vast
# majority of
# cases.
#
# The code below compares the effect of the type of window:

# %%
size = 7
for window in ["flat", "bartlett", "han", "hamming", "blackman"]:
    Xsm = Xn.smooth(size=size, window=window)
    plot(Xn, Xsm, label=f"window=`{window}` size={size}")

# %% [markdown]
# Close examination of the spectra shows that the flat window leads to the stronger
# smoothing. This is
# because the other window functions are used as weighting functions for the
# N+1 points, with the largest weight on the central point and smaller weights for
# external points.
#
# The window functions as used in SpectroChemPy are derived from the scipy library.
# These builtin functions are such
# that the value of the central point is 1. Hence, as shown below,  they are normalized
# to the sum of weights. The
# code below displays the corresponding normalized functions for size=27 points:

# %%
import numpy as np
import scipy

functions = []
labels = []
size = 27
for i, method in enumerate(["bartlett", "han", "hamming", "blackman"]):
    data = scipy.signal.get_window(method, size, fftbins=False)
    data = data / np.sum(data)

    s = scp.NDDataset(
        data + 0.02 * i
    )  # normalized window function, y shifted : +0.1 for each function
    functions.append(s)
    labels.append(f"function: {method}")

ax = scp.plot_multiple(
    figsize=(8, 5),  # ylim=(0,0.1),
    method="pen",
    datasets=functions,
    labels=labels,
    ls="-",
    lw=2,
)
_ = ax.legend(labels, loc="upper left", fontsize=10)

# %% [markdown]
# As shown above, the "bartlett" function is equivalent to a triangular window,
# while other
# functions (`hanning` , `hamming` , `blackman` ) are bell-shaped. More information on
# window functions can be found [
# here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function).

# %% [markdown]
# ### Savitzky-Golay filter:`savgol`
# Similarly, the Savitsky-Golay filter is also implemented as an API/NDDataset method:

# %%
Xsg = scp.savgol(Xn, size=5, order=2, mode="mirror")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Whittaker-eilers filter : `whittaker`
# Finally, we can also use the `whittaker` filter directly. *e.g*.:

# %%
Xw = scp.whittaker(Xn, lamb=10)
