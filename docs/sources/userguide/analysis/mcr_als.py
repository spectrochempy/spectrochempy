import spectrochempy as scp

# ## Introduction
#
# MCR-ALS (standing for Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares) is a
# popular method for resolving a set (or several sets) of spectra $X$ of an evolving
# mixture (or a set of mixtures) into the spectra $S^t$ of 'pure'
# species and their concentration profiles $C$. In terms of matrix equation:
#
# $$ X = C.S^t + E $$
#
# The ALS algorithm allows applying soft or hard constraints (e.g., non negativity,
# unimodality, equality to a given profile) to the spectra or concentration profiles
# of pure species. This property makes MCR-ALS an extremely flexible
# and powerful method.
#
# In this tutorial, the application of MCS-ALS as implemented in Scpy to a 'classical'
# dataset form the literature is presented.
#
# ## The (minimal) dataset
#
# Here, we perform the MCR ALS optimization of a dataset corresponding to
# a HPLC-DAD run, from Jaumot et al. Chemolab, 76 (2005),
# pp. 101-110 and Jaumot et al. Chemolab, 140 (2015) pp. 1-12. This dataset (and others)
# can be loaded from the
# "Multivariate Curve Resolution Homepage"
# at https://mcrals.wordpress.com/download/example-data-sets. For the user convenience,
# this dataset is present in the
# 'datadir' of spectrochempy in 'als2004dataset.MAT' and can be read as follows in Scpy:

# %%
A = scp.read_matlab("matlabdata/als2004dataset.MAT")

# %% [markdown]
# The .mat file contains 6 matrices which are thus returned in A as a list of 6
# NDDatasets. We print the names and dimensions of these datasets:

# %%
for a in A:
    print(f"{a.name} : {a.shape}")

# %% [markdown]
# In this tutorial, we are first interested in the dataset named ('m1') that contains
# a singleHPLC-DAD run(s).
# As usual, the rows correspond to the 'time axis' of the HPLC run(s), and the columns
# to the 'wavelength' axis
# of the UV spectra.
#
# Let's name it 'X' (as in the matrix equation above), display its content and plot it:

# %%
X = A[-1]
X

# %%
_ = X.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# The original dataset is the 'm1' matrix and does not contain information as to the
# actual elution time, wavelength,
# and data units. Hence, the resulting NDDataset has no coordinates and on the plot,
# only the matrix line and row
# indexes are indicated. For the clarity of the tutorial, we add: (i) a proper title
# to the data, (ii)
# the default coordinates (index) do the NDDataset and (iii) a proper name for these
# coordinates:

# %%
X.title = "absorbance"
X.set_coordset(None, None)
X.set_coordtitles(y="elution time", x="wavelength")
X

# %% [markdown]
# From now on, these names will be taken into account by Scpy in the plots as well as
# in the analysis treatments
# (PCA, EFA, MCR-ALs, ...). For instance to plot X as a surface:

# %%
surf = X.plot_surface(linewidth=0.0, figsize=(10, 5), autolayout=False)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Initial guess and MCR ALS optimization
#
# The ALS optimization of the MCR equation above requires the input of a guess for
# either the concentration matrix
# $C_0$ or the spectra matrix $S^t_0$. Given the data matrix $X$, the lacking initial
# matrix ($S^t_0$ or $C_0$,
# respectively) is computed by:
# $$ S^t_0 = \left( C_0^tC_0 \right)^{-1} C_0^t X $$
#
# or
#
# $$ C_0 = X {S^t_0}^t  \left( S_0^t {S_0^t}^t \right)^{-1} $$
#
# ### Case of initial spectral profiles
# The matrix spure provided in the initial dataset is a guess for the spectral profiles.
# Let's name it 'St0',
# and plot it:

# %%
St0 = A[3]
_ = St0.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# Note that, again, no information has been given as to the ordinate and abscissa data.
# We could add them as previously
# but this is not very important. The key point is that the 'wavelength' dimension is
# compatible with the data 'X',
# which is indeed the case (both have a length of 95). If it was not, an error would be
# generated in the following.
#
# #### ALS Optimization
# With this guess 'St0' and the dataset 'X' we can create a MCRALS object. At this point
# of the tutorial, we will use
# all the default parameters.

# %% [markdown]
# First, we create an instance of a MCRALS object:

# %%
mcr = scp.MCRALS(log_level="INFO")


# %% [markdown]
# The `fit` method of `mcr` is now used to start the iteration process.
# As the log level has been set to  "INFO" at the MCRALS instance creation,
# so we have a summary of the ALS iterations

# %%
mcr.fit(X, St0)

# %% [markdown]
# The optimization has converged within few iterations. The figures reported for each
# iteration are defined as follows:
#
# - 'Error/PCA' is the standard deviation of the residuals with respect to data
# reconstructed by a PCA with as many
# components as pure species (4 in this example),
#
# - 'Error/exp': is the standard deviation of the residuals with respect to the
# experimental data X,
#
# - '%change': is the percent change of 'Error/exp' between 2 iterations
#
# The default is to stop when this %change between two iteration is negative (so that
# the solution is improving),
# but with an absolute value lower than 0.1% (so that the improvement is considered
# negligible). This parameter -
# as well as several other parameters affecting the ALS optimization can be changed by
# the setting the 'tol' value.
# For instance:

# %%
mcr.tol = 0.01
mcr.fit(X, St0)

# %% [markdown]
# As could be expected more iterations have been necessary to reach this stricter
# convergence criterion.  The other
# convergence criterion that can be fixed by the user is 'maxdiv', the maximum number
# of successive diverging
# iterations. It is set to 5 by default and allows for stopping the ALS algorithm when
# it is no converging.
# If for instance the 'tol' is set very low, the optimization will be stopped when
# either the maximum number
# of iterations is reached (max_iter, 50 by default) or when no improvement is during 5
# successive iterations (maxdiv).

# %%
mcr.tol = 0.001
mcr.fit(X, St0)

# %% [markdown]
# #### More information about the MCRALS estimator
#
# ##### To get help about the different configuration parameters

# %%
# help(mcr)

# %%
# It is possible to chain fit runs, without recomputing everything for example for
# optimization of some parameters

mcr = scp.MCRALS(tol=0.001, log_level="INFO")
_ = mcr.fit(X, St0)

# %%
mcr1 = scp.MCRALS(tol=0.1, log_level="INFO")
_ = mcr1.fit(X, St0)

# %%
mcr1.tol = 0.01
_ = mcr1.fit(
    X, (mcr1.C.copy(), mcr1.St.copy())
)  # reuse C and ST computed at the previous run
print("second run with the output of the first")

# %%
mcr1.tol = 0.001
_ = mcr1.fit(X, (mcr1.C, mcr1.St))
print("third run with the output of the second")

# %% [markdown]
# Below we compare the outputs of the initial run (red) and final run (blue).

# %%
_ = mcr.C.T.plot(cmap=None, color="red")
_ = mcr1.C.T.plot(clear=False, cmap=None, color="blue")

_ = mcr.St.plot(cmap=None, color="red")
_ = mcr1.St.plot(clear=False, cmap=None, color="blue")

# %% [markdown]
# #### Solutions
#
# The solutions of the MCR ALS optimization are the optimized concentration (C) and pure
# spectra (St) datasets. They are stored as in the `C` and `St` attribute of the MCRAL object.
# As MCRALS is derived from to the `DecompositionAnalysis` class, C and St can also be obtained
# by `MCRALS.transform()` and MCRALS.components, respectively.
#
#  Let's generate a MCRALS
#  object with the default settings, and get the solution datasets C and St. Note that
#  the default log_level is "WARNING" so we do not see any output here.

# %%
mcr1 = scp.MCRALS()
mcr1.fit(X, St0)

# %% [markdown]
# As the dimensions of C are such that the rows' direction (C.y) corresponds to the
# elution time and the columns'
# direction (C.x) correspond to the four pure species, it is necessary to transpose
# it before plotting in order
# to plot the concentration vs. the elution time.

# %%
_ = mcr1.C.T.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# On the other hand, the spectra of the pure species can be plotted directly:

# %%
_ = mcr1.St.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# #### A basic illustration of the rotational ambiguity
# We have thus obtained the elution profiles of the four pure species. Note that the
# 'concentration' values are very
# low. This results from the fact that the absorbance values in X are on the order of
# 0-1 while the absorbance of
# the initial pure spectra are of the order of 10^4. As can be seen above,
# the absorbance of the final spectra is of
# the same order of magnitude.
#
# It is possible to normalize the intensity of the spectral profiles by setting the
# 'normSpec' parameter to True.
# With this option, the spectra are normalized such that their euclidean norm is 1.
# The other normalization option is
# normspec = 'max', whereby the maximum intensity of the spectra is 1. Let's look at
# the effect of
# both normalizations:

# %%
mcr2 = scp.MCRALS(normSpec="euclid")
mcr2.fit(X, St0)

mcr3 = scp.MCRALS(normSpec="max")
mcr3.fit(X, St0)

_ = mcr1.St.plot()
_ = mcr2.St.plot()
_ = mcr3.St.plot()

# %%
_ = mcr1.C.T.plot()
_ = mcr2.C.T.plot()
_ = mcr3.C.T.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# It is clear that the normalization affects the relative intensity of the spectra and
# of the concentration.
# This is a basic example of the well known rotational ambiguity of the MCS ALS
# solutions.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Guessing the concentration profile with PCA + EFA
#
# Generally, in MCR ALS, the initial guess cannot be obtained independently of the
# experimental data 'x'.
# In such a case, one has to rely on 'X' to obtained (i) the number of pure species
# and (ii) their initial
# concentrations or spectral profiles. The number of pure species can be assessed by
# carrying out a PCA on the
# data while the concentrations or spectral profiles can be estimated using procedures
# such EFA of SIMPLISMA.
# The following will illustrate the use of PCA followed by EFA
#
# #### Use of PCA to assess the number of pure species
#
# Let's first analyse our dataset using PCA and plot a screeplot:

# %%
pca = scp.PCA(n_components=8)
pca.fit(X)
pca.printev()
_ = pca.screeplot()

# %% [markdown]
# The number of significant PC's is clearly larger or equal to 2. It is, however,
# difficult to determine whether
# it should be set to 3 or 4...  Let's look at the score and loading matrices:
#

# %%
scores = pca.transform()
_ = pca.loadings.plot()
_ = scores.T.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# Examination of the scores and loadings indicate that the 4th component has structured,
# nonrandom scores and loadings.
# Hence, we will fix the number of pure species to 4.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Determination of initial concentrations using EFA
#
# Once the number of components has been determined, the initial concentration matrix
# is obtained very easily using EFA:
#

# %%
efa = scp.EFA()
efa.fit(X)
efa.n_components = 4
C0 = efa.transform()
_ = C0.T.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# The MCR ALS can then be launched using this new guess:

# %%
mcr4 = scp.MCRALS(max_iter=100, normSpec="euclid")
mcr4.fit(X, C0)

# %%
_ = mcr4.C.T.plot()
_ = mcr4.St.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Augmented datasets

# %% [markdown]
# The 'MATRIX' dataset is a columnwise augmented dataset consisting into 5 successive
# runs:

# %%
A[1]

# %% [markdown]
# Let's plot it as a surface and as a map:

# %%
X2 = A[1]
X2.title = "absorbance"
X2.set_coordset(None, None)
X2.set_coordtitles(y="elution time", x="wavelength")
surf = X2.plot_surface(linewidth=0.0, ccount=100, figsize=(8, 4), autolayout=False)
_ = X2.plot(method="map")

# %%
mcr5 = scp.MCRALS(unimodConc=[])
mcr5.fit(X2, St0)

# %%
_ = mcr5.C.T.plot()

# %%
_ = mcr5.St.plot()

# %% [markdown]
