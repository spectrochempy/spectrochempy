including other versions of SpectroChemPy.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  LinearCoord operations now working.
-  Baseline default now “sequential” as expected. **WARNING**: It was
   wrongly set to “mutivariate” in previous releases, so you should
   expect some difference with processing you may have done before.
-  Comparison of coordinates now correct for mathematical operations.
-  Alignment methods now working (except for multidimensional
   alignment).
