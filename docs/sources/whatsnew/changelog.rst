New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Add here new public features (do not delete this comment)

- The `readonly` attribute of the Meta object now applies to all nested objects.
- More concise HTML output in Jupyter notebooks with collapsible sections. Use CSS for styling.
- The merging behavior of NDDataset objects has been improved. Now, several groups of datasets are returned if files are not compatible.
  Note that merging is the default. To enforce non-merging of compatible files, use the `merge` keyword set to False in `read_*` calls.
- `read_opus()` has been revised and now uses the `brukeropus` package developed by Josh Duran
  (`<https://github.com/joshduran/brukeropus>`_). It can read most of the spectra types contained in OPUS files,
  as reference experiments and not only AB type spectra as previously.
- Import/Export tutorials have been updated to reflect the new `brukeropus` package.
- `read_dir()` (as well as the equivalent `read()`) has a new keyword argument `pattern` to filter files to read in a directory.
- Text output of the `plot()` method is now suppressed in Jupyter notebooks, i.e.,

  .. code-block:: ipython

    ds.plot()

  will no longer display the text output of the `plot` method but the plot alone.
