New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Add here new public features (do not delete this comment)

- The `readonly` attribute of Meta object now applies to all nested objects.
- More concise html output in jupyter notebooks with collapsible sections. Use CSS for styling.
- Merging behavior of NDDataset objects has been improved. Now several group of datasets are returned if files are not compatible.
  Note also that merging is the default. To enforce non-merging of compatible files, one must use the `merge` keywords set to False in `read_*` calls.
- `read_opus()` has been revised and now uses the `brukeropus` package developed by Josh Duran
  (`<https://github.com/joshduran/brukeropus>`_). It can read most of the spectra types contained in OPUS files,
  as reference experiment and not only AB type spectra as previously.
- Import/Export tutorials updated to reflect the new `brukeropus` package.
- `read_dir()` (as well as equivalent `read()`) has a new keyword argument `pattern` to filter files to read in a directory.`
