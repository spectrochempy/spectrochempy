Installation Guide
###################

Prerequisites
=============

|scpy| requires a working `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ installation
(version 3.6 or higher).

We highly recommend to install
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ or
`Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
distributions which are available for most
platforms and the rest of this guide will mainly use commands for this
distribution.

Miniconda is lighter (400 MB disk space) while Anaconda (3 GB minimum disk space
to download and install)
is much more complete for scientific applications if you intend using python
beyond Spectrochempy. Important
package in Anaconda are also required for spectrochempy
(e.g., `Matplotib <https://matplotlib.org>`_,
`Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_, `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org>`_,
`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_, …) They are not
included in Miniconda and will be installed anyway. So overall, the difference
in installation time/disc space
won’t be that big whether you choose Miniconda or Anaconda…

Go to `Anaconda download page <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ or
`Miniconda download page <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.

Choose your platform and download one of the available installer, *e.g.*, the
3.7 or + version.

Install the version which you just downloaded, following the instructions on
the download page.

This can take time, go and get your favorite drink...
