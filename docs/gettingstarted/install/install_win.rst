Installation Guide for Windows
===============================


Installation
-------------

.. _conda_win:

The following steps have been checked only with windows 10 but should work with
previous versions as well.

We highly recommend that all new users install |scpy| interface via Conda. You
can install Spectrochempy
in a dedicated environment (recommended, steps 4. and 5. below). You can also
use your base environment or an
existing environment (then skip steps 4. and 5.)

#.  Open a command prompt (Select the Start button and type cmd), or preferably
open the Anaconda Prompt
    in the Anaconda start Menu.

    .. image:: images/Aprompt.png
       :width: 200
       :alt: Anaconda Prompt

#.  Update conda (yes, even if you have just installed the distribution...):

    .. sourcecode:: bat

        (base) C:\<yourDefaultPath>> conda update conda

    where `<yourDefaultPath>` is you default workspace directory (often:
`C:\\Users\\<user>`)

#.  Add channels to get specific packages:

    .. sourcecode:: bat

        (base) C:\<yourDefaultPath>> conda config --add channels conda-forge
        (base) C:\<yourDefaultPath>> conda config --add channels cantera
        (base) C:\<yourDefaultPath>> conda config --add channels spectrocat

#.  Recommended: you can create a dedicated environment. We will name it
`scpy` in this
    example

    .. sourcecode:: bat

        (base) C:\<yourDefaultPath>> conda create --name scpy

#.  Recommended: switch to this environment. At this point, `(scpy)` should
appear before
    the prompt instead of `(base)`.

    .. sourcecode:: bat

        (base) C:\<yourDefaultPath>> conda activate scpy
        (scpy) C:\<yourDefaultPath>>

    .. Note::

        You can make the scipy environment permanent by creating and using the
following batch file (.bat)

        .. sourcecode:: bat

            @REM launch a cmd window in scpy environment (path should beadapted)
            @CALL CD C:\<yourWorkingFolder>
            @CALL CMD /K C:\<yourAnacondaFolder>\Scripts\activate.bat scpy

        This script, where `<yourAnacondaFolder>` is the installation directory
        of your Miniconda/Anaconda distribution
        will open a command prompt  in  C:\\<yourWorkingFolder> with the `scpy`
        environment activated.

        Save the .bat file, for instance in
        `C:\\<yourAnacondaFolder>\Scripts\activate-scpy.bat`,
        create a shortcut, name it, for instance, `Anaconda prompt (scpy)`
        and place it in an easily accessible
        place (e.g. the Windows Startmenu Folder).

#. Install |scpy|

    .. sourcecode:: bat

        (scpy) C:\<yourDefaultPath>> conda install spectrochempy

    This can take time, depending on your python installation and the number of
    missing packages.

Install a developper version (Advanced usage)
----------------------------------------------

Installation of the developper version is described here:  :ref:`develguide`.

Check the Installation
------------------------

Check the installation by running a
`IPython <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ session by issuing in
the terminal the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bat

    (scpy) C:\<yourDefaultPath>> ipython

Then execute the following command:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: from spectrochempy import *

If this goes well, you should see the following output, indicating that
Spectrochempy is likely functional !

.. sourcecode:: ipython

    SpectroChemPy's API - v.0.1.17
