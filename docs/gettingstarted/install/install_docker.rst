Install a Docker container
***************************

Docker is an open platform for shipping, and running applications. It allows to run
|scpy| in an unified environment whatever the host platform is,
avoiding all potential installation problems as the images created have been tested before being shipped.

Installation
============

Before going further, if **Docker** is not yet installed on your system, you need to install it.
Refer to `this page <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>`__ to download the
version you need.

Additional steps on windows
----------------------------

* `Enable WSL, install a Linux distribution, and update to WSL 2 <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps>`__.

  - Open PowerShell as Administrator : to do this **RIGHT**-click on the start button and select `Windows Powershell (admin)`

  - run

  .. sourcecode:: shell

     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

  - Restart your machine to complete the WSL install.

  - Update WSL to version 2:

    * Download the latest package : `WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines <WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines>`__
      and install.

    * Open PowerShell and run this command to set WSL 2 as the default version.

    .. sourcecode:: powershell

       wsl --set-default-version 2

    ..    - Install a linux distribution, e.g.,
    ..   `the lightweight Alpine WSL (on Microsoft Store) <https://aka.ms/wslstore>`__.
    ..    or another of your choice.

- Install `Docker Desktop <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>`__.

  - Once installed, start Docker Desktop from the Windows Start menu, then select the Docker icon from the hidden icons
    menu of your taskbar. Right-click the icon to display the Docker commands menu and select "Settings".

    .. image:: images/docker1.png
       :alt: docker_hidden_menu

    * Ensure that "Use the WSL 2 based engine" is checked in Settings > General.

   TO BE COMPLETED


Executing a |scpy| Docker container
=========================================

This be done using the following ``Docker run`` command :

.. sourcecode:: bash

   docker run -v /path/on/host:/home/jovyan/work \
              -p 8888:8888 \
              --name scpy \
              spectrocat/spectrochempy:latest \
              start.sh jupyter lab

This command will create a container where python, jupyter lab and spectrochempy are preinstalled. During the
creation of the container, the image containing these componrents will be downloaded from our Docker repository.

.. note::

   This may take a while the first time this command is executed due to the size of the image to be downloaded, but
   once this is done, the image will be saved on your system so it will not be downloaded again except
   some update are detected

**Description of the parameters**

* ``-v`` or ``--volume`` allows to bind a local directory with the Docker application. For instance if you
  want to works on files located in ``C:\Users\toto\mywork``, you can use:

  ``-v //C:/Users/myaccount/mywork:/home/jovyan/work``.

  Note that ``backslash (\)`` separator of windows path must be replaced by simple ``slash (/)``.

  The container will be unable to access directories at upper levels than those specified in ``-v`` bindings. Thus if
  for instance you need to access to a directory where you your data are savec you will need to write a binding
  explicitly. You can bind as many directory you want.

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     docker run -v /path/on/host:/home/jovyan/work \
                -v /another/path/on/host:/home/jovyan/data \
                -p 8888:8888 \
                --name scpy-latest \
                spectrocat/spectrochempy:latest \
                start.sh jupyter lab

  Another possibility is to select for example your home directory; in this
  case you will have access as on your local system to all files accessibles
  from here.

* ``-p`` is used to map an host port to the internal container port=8888 used by jupyter lab by default (It is not
  directly accessible). For instance, if you write -p 10000:8888, the Jupyter Lab application will be accessible on the
  host on port 10000.

* ``--name``: This is optional to specify a container name. If not given a random name will be chosen.

* ``spectrocat/spectrochempy:latest`` This is the name of the image to download.

* ``start.sh jupyter lab`` This is a command to start the Jupyter lab server.

Once the ``Docker run`` command is exectuted in a terminal, it will output some information and display the internal
address at the end:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   ...

   To access the server, open this file in a browser:

   file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-8-open.html

   Or copy and paste one of these URLs:

      http://982b516d00bd:8888/lab?token=45bf716d7cf02f1b7157448de04db163df5e80eb78920004

   or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=45bf716d7cf02f1b7157448de04db163df5e80eb78920004

Go to you browser and paste ``http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=45bf716d7cf02f1b7157448de04db163df5e80eb78920004`` in
the address bar to display the application interface.
It your port binding is different, for example ``-p 10000:8888``, then you will have to change this address to:
``http://127.0.0.1:10000/lab?token=45bf716d7cf02f1b7157448de04db163df5e80eb78920004``. The token string is necessary
for security reason, but can be replaced by a password.

.. note::

   The first time the Jupyter Lab session is opened for the container, it will need to rebuild the extensions. Click
   on the accept button when you are required to do so.
