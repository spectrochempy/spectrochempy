@article{mcdonald:1988,
	abstract = { JCAMP-DX is a standard file form for exchange of infrared spectra and related chemical and physical information between spectrometer data systems of different manufacture, main-frame time-sharing systems, general purpose lab computers, and personal computers. It is compatible with all media: telephone, magnetic and optical disk, magnetic tape, and even the printed page (via optical reader).All data are stored as labeled fields of variable length using printable ASCII characters. A JCAMP-DX spectrum is a text file which can be viewed, corrected, and annotated with a text editor. The present focus is on infrared spectra, but JCAMP-DX can easily accommodate Raman, UV, NMR, mass, and other types of spectra, x-ray powder patterns, chromatograms, thermograms, and other plots which require the capability of representing contours as well as peak position and intensity. JCAMP-DX also provides for combining adequate information about the sample and method of observation with its spectrum. },

	abstract = {An updated version of the graphical user-friendly interface related to the Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm is presented. This GUI works under MATLAB{\textregistered} environment and includes recently published advances of this algorithm linked to the implementation of additional constraints, such as kinetic hard-modeling and correlation (calibration), as well as constraints linked to model structure for multiset and multi-way data analysis, such as the possibility to use fully or partially multilinear models (trilinear or quadrilinear) to describe the data set. In addition, a step has been included to allow the preliminary subspace maximum likelihood projection to decrease noise propagation effects in case of large non-homoscedastic uncertainties, and the possibility of direct selection of number of components and of initial estimates. Finally, a number of options to present and handle the output information have been added, such as the display of data fitting evolution, improvement in the display of loading profiles in different modes for multi-way data, refolding MCR scores into 2D distribution maps for hyperspectral images and the internal connection to the MCR-Bands GUI, previously designed for the assessment of the extent and location of ambiguities in the MCR resolved profiles. Different examples of use of this updated interface are given in this work.},

The algorithm involves the Menger curvature of a circumcircle and the golden section search method. It efficiently finds the regularisation parameter value corresponding to the maximum positive curvature region of the L-curve. The algorithm is applied to some commonly available test problems and compared to the typical way of locating the l-curve corner by means of its analytical curvature. The application of the algorithm to the data processing of an electrical resistance tomography experiment on thin conductive films is also reported.},

@article{stelmachowski:2013,
	abstract = {A new methodology based on the inversion of adsorption isotherms obtained using infrared spectroscopy has been developed. It provides a description of coexisting surface species in terms of their individual IR spectra and surface affinities in a new two dimensional{,} 2D IR spectroscopic technique. When implemented with simultaneous gravimetric analysis{,} it further provides the quantification of adsorbed species. The adsorption of CO2 on monoclinic ZrO2 was investigated using this technique with temperature and pressure ranges of 353--673 K and 10−4--0.4 bar{,} respectively. The sets of spectra obtained at constant temperature and variable pressures (spectroscopic isotherms) were inverted assuming they obey a generalized Langmuir isotherm. This procedure yields a 2D map in which the IR spectra of the prominent surface species formed upon CO2 adsorption are resolved in one dimension -- hydrogen carbonates{,} bidentate carbonates and polydentate carbonates -- while these species are resolved according to their surface adsorption affinities (logarithm of adsorption equilibrium constants{,} ln K) on the other dimension. This technique also allows for the unambiguous determination of the thermodynamic stabilities of the various adsorbed species. The inversion of the gravimetric isotherms recorded simultaneously with the infrared spectra leads to a quantitative distribution function of CO2 adsorption sites whose components match those of the 2D infrared map and allows for a straightforward quantification of the corresponding sites{,} namely (i) weakly basic sites leading to bridged carbonates{,} hydrogen carbonates and bidentate carbonates (∼0.7 μmol m−2{,} ΔadsH = −70 to 90 kJ mol−1){,} (ii) mild basic sites leading to a second type of bidentate carbonates (∼0.8 μmol m−2{,} ΔadsH = −110 to 120 kJ mol−1) and (iii) strong basic sites leading to polydentate carbonate species (∼0.1 μmol m−2{,} ΔadsH < −120 kJ mol−1). Finally{,} the advantages and limitations of the present methodology are discussed. Because this technique is not limited to a particular spectroscopy or physical process{,} it should find other applications in the field of spectroscopic characterization of surfaces.},

	abstract = {The conversion of isobutanol to light olefins over zeolites was investigated by IR operando spectroscopy. FER zeolites showed a surprisingly high selectivity for the direct conversion of iso-butanol to linear butenes, hence catalyzing dehydration and skeletal isomerization in one step. As a fundamental understanding of the separate reactions is required to design superior catalysts, an in-situ and operando FT-IR mechanistic study of the reaction was carried out. The spectroscopic data, the derived species participating and their respective role are analyzed using chemometric (PCA and MCR-ALS) tools. We highlighted the role played by the external acid sites and the requirement of a specific distance between these sites to ensure the n-butene selectivity and point that the internal Br{\o}nsted acidity has an adverse effect on the catalyst stability. Moreover, there is no correlation between the carbon species formed on the surface and the exceptional selectivity towards n-butenes, allowing to exclude a ``carbon pool'' mechanism.},

@article{oliviero:2021,
	abstract = {Sulfided CoMo supported on TiO2, Al2O3, or SiO2 was studied by CO adsorption followed by infrared spectroscopy (IR/CO). The inversion of adsorption isotherms obtained by IR spectroscopy (the 2D-IRIS method) was performed on promoted and nonpromoted catalysts to verify that ν(CO) vibration contributions from 2090 to 2000 cm−1 can be attributed to CO/CoMoS interactions, free of the contribution coming from the CO/nonpromoted S-edges of MoS2 nanoparticles. The second derivative of the spectra evidences the presence of three different promoted sites. Promotion of MoS2 by in situ chemical vapor deposition makes it possible to ascribe the different ν(CO/CoMoS) contributions to partially or totally promoted M-edges (2072--2074 cm−1, 2082--2085 cm−1) and partially promoted S-edges (2054--2057 cm−1). Then the IR/CO method highlights Co promotion on both edges (the S-edge and the M-edge) of MoS2 slabs. The hydrodesulfurization activity of these catalysts shows that the total concentration of promoted sites is an important but not unique factor, since the structures of the CoMoS sites modify their intrinsic activity. A parallel with the different CoMoS site amounts reveals that partially promoted M-edge sites of CoMo-supported catalysts are the most active for hydrodesulfurization. This makes IR/CO a direct way to account for the most active types of promoted sites of CoMo supported catalysts.},

We applied it to study the IR-active surface species formed on a SiO2 support and on a 3 wt% Ru/SiO2 catalyst{,} which can help to reveal the important surface reaction mechanisms during the plasma-catalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM). Moreover{,} we present a technique for the challenging task of estimating the temperature of a catalyst sample in a plasma-catalytic system in situ and during plasma operation. We found that during the reaction{,} water is immediately formed at the SiO2 surface{,} and physisorbed formic acid is formed with a delay. As Ru/SiO2 is subject to greater plasma-induced heating than SiO2 (with a surface temperature increase in the range of 70--120 $\,^{\circ}$C{,} with peaks up to 150 $\,^{\circ}$C){,} we observe lower amounts of physisorbed water on Ru/SiO2{,} and less physisorbed formic acid formation. Importantly{,} the formation of surface species on the catalyst sample in our plasma-catalytic setup{,} as well as the observed conversions and selectivities in plasma conditions{,} can not be explained by plasma-induced heating of the catalyst surface{,} but must be attributed to other plasma effects{,} such as the adsorption of plasma-generated radicals and molecules{,} or the occurrence of Eley--Rideal reactions.},
