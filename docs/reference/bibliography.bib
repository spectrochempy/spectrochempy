@article{katsumoto:2003,
	abstract = { Quantitative data analysis and high-sensitivity measurements by use of Raman and infrared spectroscopy often suffer from noisy spikes such as those due to cosmic rays and water vapor. Since these spikes are unidirectional and isolated, the conventional smoothing techniques do a poor job of removing them. However, a small modification can improve these smoothing techniques significantly. In this paper, we present a simple denoising technique for a single-scan spectrum that is corrupted by convex spikes. In general, the noisy spikes arising from cosmic rays or water vapor have a much narrower bandwidth compared with target ``informative'' bands in Raman and infrared spectra. This means that these noisy spikes can be separated from the target bands by means of the difference in the bandwidths. The proposed method employs the moving window averaging procedure to distinguish and separate the convex spike. The proposed algorithm allows us to take away the convex spikes from measured spectra without preparing multiply recorded spectra and (much) biasing the measured spectrum. },

abstract = {Raman Spectroscopy is a widely used analytical technique, favoured when molecular specificity with minimal sample preparation is required. The majority of Raman instruments use charge-coupled device (ccd) detectors, these are susceptible to cosmic rays and as such multiple spurious spikes can occur in the measurement. These spikes are problematic as they may hinder subsequent analysis, particularly if multivariate data analysis is required. In this work we present a new algorithm to remove these spikes from spectra after acquisition. Specifically, our algorithm uses modified Z scores calculated from the once-differenced detrended spectrum to locate the offending spikes, followed by a simple moving average to remove them. The algorithm is very simple and its execution is essentially instantaneous, resulting in spike-free spectra with minimal distortion of actual Raman data. The presented algorithm represents an improvement on existing spike removal methods by utilising simple, easy to understand mathematical concepts, making it ideal for experts and non-experts alike.}

	abstract = { A general method for estimating reaction rate constants of chemical reactions using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy is presented. The only requirement is that some of the chemical components involved be spectroscopically active. The method uses the combination of spectroscopic measurements and techniques from numerical mathematics and chemometrics. Therefore, the method can be used in cases where a large spectral overlap of the individual reacting absorbing species is present. No knowledge about molar absorbances of individual reacting absorbing species is required for quantification. The reaction rate constants and the individual spectra of the reacting absorbing species of the two-step consecutive reaction of 3-chlorophenylhydrazonopropane dinitrile with 2-mercaptoethanol were estimated simultaneously from UV-vis recorded spectra in time. The results obtained were excellent. },

In addition, a step has been included to allow the preliminary subspace maximum likelihood projection to decrease noise propagation effects in case of large non-homoscedastic uncertainties, and the possibility of direct selection of number of components and of initial estimates. Finally, a number of options to present and handle the output information have been added, such as the display of data fitting evolution, improvement in the display of loading profiles in different modes for multi-way data, refolding MCR scores into 2D distribution maps for hyperspectral images and the internal connection to the MCR-Bands GUI, previously designed for the assessment of the extent and location of ambiguities in the MCR resolved profiles. Different examples of use of this updated interface are given in this work.},

@incollection{maeder:2009,
	abstract = {Evolving factor analysis (EFA) has originally been developed for the analysis of chemical processes that proceed in a well-defined way. Often the process is governed by time, for example chromatography, but it can also be the addition of a reagent, for example in a titration. EFA detects the appearance of new compounds during the process by analyzing submatrices of the complete data set; different types of EFA have different ways of systematically assembling these submatrices. The collection of appearances can then be unraveled in terms of concentration windows, which can be further used in subsequent more detailed analyses. It is important to realize that EFA is primarily a change detector rather than a window detector. The principle of submatrix analysis has recently been extended to the novel two-dimensional-EFA (2D-EFA) of hyperspectral images. Instead of a series of spectra collected as a function of a chemical process, a group of neighboring spectra measured of a sample are analyzed as a unit. This gives local rank information, which can be interpreted subsequently according to the nature of the sample. EFA can be computationally very demanding; however, there are ways by which computation times can be considerably reduced.},

	abstract = {A new methodology based on the inversion of adsorption isotherms obtained using infrared spectroscopy has been developed. It provides a description of coexisting surface species in terms of their individual IR spectra and surface affinities in a new two dimensional{,} 2D IR spectroscopic technique. When implemented with simultaneous gravimetric analysis{,} it further provides the quantification of adsorbed species. The adsorption of CO2 on monoclinic ZrO2 was investigated using this technique with temperature and pressure ranges of 353--673 K and 10−4--0.4 bar{,} respectively. The sets of spectra obtained at constant temperature and variable pressures (spectroscopic isotherms) were inverted assuming they obey a generalized Langmuir isotherm. This procedure yields a 2D map in which the IR spectra of the prominent surface species formed upon CO2 adsorption are resolved in one dimension -- hydrogen carbonates{,} bidentate carbonates and polydentate carbonates -- while these species are resolved according to their surface adsorption affinities (logarithm of adsorption equilibrium constants{,} ln K) on the other dimension. This technique also allows for the unambiguous determination of the thermodynamic stabilities of the various adsorbed species. The inversion of the gravimetric isotherms recorded simultaneously with the infrared spectra leads to a quantitative distribution function of CO2 adsorption sites whose components match those of the 2D infrared map and allows for a straightforward quantification of the corresponding sites{,} namely (i) weakly basic sites leading to bridged carbonates{,} hydrogen carbonates and bidentate carbonates (∼0.7 μmol m−2{,} ΔadsH = −70 to 90 kJ mol−1){,} (ii) mild basic sites leading to a second type of bidentate carbonates (∼0.8 μmol m−2{,} ΔadsH = −110 to 120 kJ mol−1) and (iii) strong basic sites leading to polydentate carbonate species (∼0.1 μmol m−2{,} ΔadsH < −120 kJ mol−1). Finally{,} the advantages and limitations of the present methodology are discussed. Because this technique is not limited to a particular spectroscopy or physical process{,} it should find other applications in the field of spectroscopic characterization of surfaces.},

	abstract = {The conversion of isobutanol to light olefins over zeolites was investigated by IR operando spectroscopy. FER zeolites showed a surprisingly high selectivity for the direct conversion of iso-butanol to linear butenes, hence catalyzing dehydration and skeletal isomerization in one step. As a fundamental understanding of the separate reactions is required to design superior catalysts, an in-situ and operando FT-IR mechanistic study of the reaction was carried out. The spectroscopic data, the derived species participating and their respective role are analyzed using chemometric (PCA and MCR-ALS) tools. We highlighted the role played by the external acid sites and the requirement of a specific distance between these sites to ensure the n-butene selectivity and point that the internal Br{\o}nsted acidity has an adverse effect on the catalyst stability. Moreover, there is no correlation between the carbon species formed on the surface and the exceptional selectivity towards n-butenes, allowing to exclude a ``carbon pool'' mechanism.},

	abstract = {Sulfided CoMo supported on TiO2, Al2O3, or SiO2 was studied by CO adsorption followed by infrared spectroscopy (IR/CO). The inversion of adsorption isotherms obtained by IR spectroscopy (the 2D-IRIS method) was performed on promoted and nonpromoted catalysts to verify that ν(CO) vibration contributions from 2090 to 2000 cm−1 can be attributed to CO/CoMoS interactions, free of the contribution coming from the CO/nonpromoted S-edges of MoS2 nanoparticles. The second derivative of the spectra evidences the presence of three different promoted sites. Promotion of MoS2 by in situ chemical vapor deposition makes it possible to ascribe the different ν(CO/CoMoS) contributions to partially or totally promoted M-edges (2072--2074 cm−1, 2082--2085 cm−1) and partially promoted S-edges (2054--2057 cm−1). Then the IR/CO method highlights Co promotion on both edges (the S-edge and the M-edge) of MoS2 slabs. The hydrodesulfurization activity of these catalysts shows that the total concentration of promoted sites is an important but not unique factor, since the structures of the CoMoS sites modify their intrinsic activity. A parallel with the different CoMoS site amounts reveals that partially promoted M-edge sites of CoMo-supported catalysts are the most active for hydrodesulfurization. This makes IR/CO a direct way to account for the most active types of promoted sites of CoMo supported catalysts.},

As the integrated molar absorption coefficients of Py complexes with Br{\o}nsted and Lewis acid sites, ɛ(Py-B) and ɛ(Py-L), are determined and the validity of the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law for IR characterisation of solid acids is demonstrated, this work is setting a benchmark for the quantitative acidity measurements in zeolites and related materials. The following values of ɛ(Py-B) have been obtained at 150 $\,^{\circ}$C (band at ~1545 cm−1): 1.09 $\pm$ 0.08 cm µmol−1 for ZSM-5; 1.12 $\pm$ 0.16 cm µmol−1 for BEA; 1.29 $\pm$ 0.04 cm µmol−1 for MOR and 1.54 $\pm$ 0.15 cm µmol−1 for FAU. The value of ɛ(Py-L) (band at ~1455 cm−1, which refers to different cations) measured at the same temperature is 1.71 $\pm$ 0.1 cm µmol−1. Values of ɛ(Py-B) depend on the zeolite structure, in contrast to that for ɛ(Py-L). Clear correlations are presented between the temperature of the FTIR measurements and ɛ values for Py complexes and other species, which decrease by ~10% as the temperature increases by 100 $\,^{\circ}$C. In addition, the effects of key experimental procedures, instrumentation design and sample preparation are established and quantified.},

	abstract = {Abstract Multivariate curve resolution techniques try to estimate physically and/or chemically meaningful profiles underlying a set of chemical or related measurements. However, the estimation of profiles is not generally unique and it is often complicated by intensity and rotational ambiguities. Constraints as further information of chemical entities can be imposed to reduce the extent of ambiguities. Not only a long list of constraints has been introduced but also some of them can be applied in different ways. Either investigating constraint effects on the extent of rotational ambiguity or how they can be applied during curve resolution can shed light on curve resolution studies. The motivation behind this contribution is to pave the way to a clarification about the closure constraint. Considering simulated equilibrium and kinetic spectrophotometric data sets, different approaches to closure implementation were applied to demonstrate the geometrical explanation of closure constraint and its effect on multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares results. Besides, the closure constraint is compared with normalization and it is proved that the closure constraint is a Borgen norm and has the same effect as other Borgen norms in multivariate curve resolution. Finally, to further examine the closure constraint, a real data set was investigated.},

The combination of gravimetric analysis and IR spectroscopy makes it possible to monitor and distinguish diffusion

mechanical mixture of FAU and MFI zeolites. Analysis of both gravimetric uptake curves and evolving infrared spectra

abstract = {Background: Raman spectroscopists are familiar with the challenge of dealing with spikes caused by cosmic
rays. These artifacts may lead to errors in subsequent data processing steps, such as for example calibration,
normalization or spectral search. Spike removal is therefore a fundamental step in Raman spectral data pre-treatment,
but access to publicly accessible code for spike removal tools is limited, and their performance for spectra correction
often unknown. Therefore, there is a need for development and testing open-source and easy-to-implement algorithms that
improve the Raman data processing workflow.
Results: In this work, we present and validate two approaches for spike detection and correction in Raman spectral data
from graphene: i) An algorithm based on the peaks' widths and prominences and ii) an algorithm based on the ratio of
these two peak features. The first algorithm provides an efficient and reliable approach for spike detection in real
and synthetic Raman spectra by imposing thresholds on the peaks’ width and prominence. The second approach leverages
the prominence/width ratio for outlier detection. It relies on the calculation of a limit of detection based on either
one or several spectra, enabling the automatic identification of cosmic ray and low-intensity noise-originated spikes
alike. Both algorithms detect low-intensity spikes down to at least ≈10% of the highest Raman peak of spectra with
different noise levels. To address their limitations and prove their versatility, the algorithms were further tested
in Raman spectra from calcite and polystyrene.
Significance: Our intuitive, open-source algorithms have been validated and allow automatic correction for a given set
of samples. They do not require any pre-processing steps such as calibration or baseline subtraction, and their
implementation with Python libraries is computationally efficient, allowing for immediate utilization within existing
open-source packages for Raman spectra processing.}

abstract  ="As batteries drive the transition to electrified transportation and energy systems, ensuring their quality,
reliability, lifetime, and safety is crucial. While the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is known to govern these
performance characteristics, its dynamic nature makes understanding its nucleation, growth, and composition an
ambitious, yet elusive aspiration. This work employs chalcogenide fibres embedded in negative electrode materials for
operando Infra-red Fibre-optic Evanescent Wave Spectroscopy (IR-FEWS), combined with Multivariate Curve Resolution by
Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) algorithms for spectra analysis. By establishing molecular fingerprints that can be
used to identify reaction products, IR-FEWS combined with MCR-ALS enables improved understanding of SEI evolution
during cell formation with notable differences stemming from electrolyte or anode material. For example, despite
operating at an elevated potential, lithium titanate’s SEI has intrinsic instability, evidenced by continued carbonate
formation. This approach leads the hunt for the SEI down a new path, giving empirical formulations theoretical roots.
