New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Add here new public features (do not delete this comment)

* A new reader has been added: `read_wire` (alias `read_wdf``) to read data from
  the .wdf format (WDF) files produced by the ReniShaw WiRe software.
  This reader is based on the `py_wdf_reader <https://github.com/alchem0x2A/py-wdf-reader>`_ package.
* Added an example for NMR processing.
* Peak finding now handles dimensions other than x (important when data are transposed, or when working on a slice in dimension other than x)
* Analysis methods now accept complex input data, but work only on the real part of the data.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
.. Add here new bug fixes (do not delete this comment)

* Fix a bug when slicing dataset with an array or list of index: Multi-coordinates
  were not correctly handled.
* Increase the value of the coordinate linearization condition from 0.1% to 1% spacing variation.
  (linearization was sometimes lost when slicing)
* Fix a missing correction for non-negative spectra in MCR-ALS.
