Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Add here new breaking changes (do not delete this comment)

This version introduce a full refactoring of the Spectrochempy analysis functions.
See the examples in order to understand the changes.

* For a rapid transition note that calling the analysis function is now done in two steps.
  When before, one was writing

  .. code-block:: ipython

      # change log level
      scp.set_loglevel("INFO")
      # init the MCRALS object and fit the model on X dataset using a guess.
      mcr = scp.MCRALS(X, guess, tol=0.001)
      # use the MCRALS object attributes
      mcr.C.T.plot()
      mcr.St.plot()


  now one would write:

  .. code-block:: ipython

     # init the MCRALS object
     mcr = scp.MCRALS(log_level="INFO", tol=0.001)
     # fit the model on X dataset using a guess.
     mcr.fit(X, guess)
     # use the MCRALS object attributes
     mcr.C.T.plot()
     mcr.St.plot()

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Add here new deprecations (do not delete this comment)

* Analysis object methods such as  `reconstruct` and `reduce` are now deprecated.
  Use `inverse_transform` and `transform`\ ,instead, in line with
  the method naming in `sklearn`\ .
