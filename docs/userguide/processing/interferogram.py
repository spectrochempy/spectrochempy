# # FTIR interferogram processing
#
# A situation where we need transform of real data is the case of FTIR interferograms.

# %%
import spectrochempy as scp
from spectrochempy.units import ur

# %%
ir = scp.read_spa("irdata/interferogram/interfero.SPA")

# %% [markdown]
# By default, the interferogram is displayed with an axis in points (no units).

# %%
prefs = ir.preferences
prefs.figure.figsize = (7, 3)
_ = ir.plot()
print('number of points = ', ir.size)

# %% [markdown]
# Plotting a zoomed region around the maximum of the interferogram (the so-called `ZPD`: `Zero optical Path
# Difference` ) we can see that it is located around the 64th points. The FFT processing will need this information,
# but it will be determined automatically.

# %%
_ = ir.plot(xlim=(0, 128))

# %% [markdown]
# The `x` scale of the interferogramme can also be displayed as a function of optical path difference. For this we
# just make `show_datapoints` to False:

# %%
ir.x.show_datapoints = False
_ = ir.plot(xlim=(-0.04, 0.04))

# %% [markdown]
# Note that the `x` scale of the interferogram has been calculated using a laser frequency of 15798.26 cm$^{-1}$. If
# this is not correct you can change it using the `set_laser_frequency` coordinate method:

# %%
ir.x.set_laser_frequency(15798.26 * ur('cm^-1'))

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can perform the Fourier transform. By default no zero-filling level is applied prior the Fourier transform
# for FTIR. To add some level of zero-filling, use the `zf` method.

# %%
ird = ir.dc()
ird = ird.zf(size=2 * ird.size)
irt = ird.fft()

_ = irt.plot(xlim=(3999, 400))

# %% [markdown]
# A `Happ-Genzel` (Hamming window) apodization can also applied prior to the
# Fourier transformation in order to decrease the H2O narrow bands.

# %%
ird = ir.dc()
irdh = ird.hamming()
irdh.zf(inplace=True, size=2 * ird.size)
irth = irdh.fft()
_ = irth.plot(xlim=(3999, 400))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Comparison with the OMNIC processing.
#
# Here we compare the OMNIC processed spectra of the same interferogram and ours in red. One can see that the results
# are very close

# %%
irs = scp.read_spa("irdata/interferogram/spectre.SPA")
prefs.figure.figsize = (7, 6)
_ = irs.plot(label='omnic')
_ = (irt - .4).plot(c='red', clear=False, xlim=(3999, 400), label='no hamming')
ax = (irth - .2).plot(c='green', clear=False, xlim=(3999, 400), label='hamming')
_ = ax.legend()
