# # Import Data
#
# This tutorial shows how to import data in **SpectroChemPy (SCPy)**.
#
# First, let's ``import spectrochempy as scp`` in the current
# namespace, so that all spectrochempy commands will be called as ``scp.method(<method parameters>)``.

# %%

import spectrochempy as scp

# ## Dialog boxes
#
# Retrieving Files and Directories, in day-to-day work is often made through Dialog Boxes. While we do not recommend
# this procedure for advanced usage (see below), it is quite easy to do that with SCPy. To do so, we can use the
# `read` function which open a dialog, allowing the selection of data file form various origin. By default,
# the native SCPy type of data is proposed (file suffix: `.scp`). The desired type of files to display can be chosen
# in a dropdown field.

# %%

X = scp.read()

# %% [markdown]
# The dialog box such as shown in this image:
#
# <center><img id='drawings' width='600px'  src='./images/read.png'></img></center>
#
# The dialog Box allows selecting the file which data will be loaded in the variable `X`. Try for instance to run the
# cell below, and select an omnic spg datafile (select the .spg extension), which you can find in the `irdata`
# directory.
#
# <div class='alert alert-warning'>
# <b>Tip</b>
#
# the dialog box does not necessarily pop up in the foreground: check your task bar !
# </div>
#
# Printing the returned NDDataset object X should read like this, with indication of the dataset `shape`, *i.e.,
# * the `y` and  `x` dimension sizes:

# %%

print(X)

# %% [markdown]
# The size of the `y` and `x` dimension will depend, of course, of the file that you have selected ! If you did not
# select any file (*e.g.,* by pressing 'cancel' in th Dialog Box), the result will be `None`, as nothing has been loaded
# in `X`.
#
# <div class='alert alert-info'>
# <b>Note</b>
#
# By default, the Dialog Box opens in the last directory you have used. However, if a directory path is specified,
# the dialog should open from this diectory.
# </div>

# %%

X = scp.read_omnic("irdata/subdir")
print(X)

# %% [markdown]
# See below for more information
#
# - At the time of writing this tutorial (SpectroChemPy v.0.1.23), the following commands will behave similarly:
#     - `read` to open any kind of recognised data files based on the file suffix (e.g., *.spg, etc...)
#     - `read_omnic` to open omnic (spa and spg) files
#     - `read_opus` to open Bruker Opus (*.0, ...) files
#     - `read_labspec` to open LABSPEC6 files - this assumes they have been exported as *.txt files
#     - `read_topspin` to open Bruker Topspin NMR files
#     - `read_csv` to open csv files
#     - `read_jcamp` to open an IR JCAMP-DX datafile
#     - `read_matlab` to open MATLAB (.mat) files including Eingenvector's Dataset objects
#
#
# - Additionally
#     - `read_dir` to open readable files in a directory
#
#
# - The list of readers available will hopefully increase in future **SCPy** releases:-)
#
# If successful, the output of the above cell should read something like
#
#     Out[2] NDDataset: [float64] a.u. (shape: (y:4, x:5549))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Import with explicit directory or file pathnames
#
# While the use of Dialog Box seems at first 'user-friendly', you will probably experience that this is often **NOT**
# efficient because you will have to select the file *each time* the notebook (or the script) is run... Hence, the
# above commands can be used with the indication of the path to a directory, and/or to a filename.
#
# If only a directory is indicated, the dialog box will open in this directory.
#
# Note that on Windows the path separator is a backslash `\`. However, in many contexts,
# backslash is also used as an escape character in order to represent non-printable characters. To avoid problems,
# either it has to be escaped itself,  a double backslash or one can also use raw string literals
# to represent Windows paths. These are string literals that have an `r` prepended to them. In raw string literals
# the `\` represents a literal backslash: `r'C:\users\Brian'`:
#
# For instance, on Windows systems, the two following commands are fully equivalent:
#
# ```ipython3
# X = scp.read_omnic(directory='C:\\users\\Brian')
# ```
#
# or
#
# ```ipython3
# X = scp.read_omnic(directory=r'C:\users\Brian')
# ```
#
# and will open the dialog box at the root directory of the `C:` drive.
#
# You can avoid using the form `\\` or the use of raw strings by using conventional slash `/`. In python,
# they play the path separator role, as well in Windows than in other UNIX-based system (Linux, OSX, ...)
#
# ```ipython3
# X = scp.read_omnic(directory='C:/users/Brian')
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# If a `filename` is passed in argument, like here:
# ```ipython3
# X = scp.read_omnic('wodger.spg', directory='C:/')
# ```
# then SpectroChemPy will attempt opening a file named `wodger.spg` supposedly located in `C:\`.
#
#
# Imagine now that the file of interest is actually located in `C:\users\Brian\s\Life`. The following
# commands are all equivalent and will allow opening the file:
#
# - using only the full pathname of the file:
# ```ipython3
# X = scp.read_omnic('C:/users/Brian/s/Life/wodger.spg')
# ```
#
# - or using a combination of directory and file pathnames:
# ```ipython3
# X = scp.read_omnic('wodger.spg', directory='C:/users/Brian/s/Life'
# X = scp.read_omnic('Life/wodger.spg', directory='C:/users/Brian/s')
# ```
#
# - etc...

# %% [markdown]
# ### A good practice: use relative paths
#
# The above directives require explicitly writing the absolute pathnames, which are virtually always computer specific.
# If, for instance, Brian has a project organised in a folder (`s`) with a directory dedicated to input data (`Life`)
# and a notebook for preprocessing (`welease.ipynb`) as illustrate below:
#
# ```
# C:\users
# |    +-- Brian
# |    |    +-- s
# |    |    |   +-- Life
# |    |    |   |   +-- wodger.spg
# |    |    |   +-- welease.ipynb
#
# ```
#
# Then running this project in John's Linux computer (e.g. in `\home\john\s_copy`) will certainly result in execution
# errors if absolute paths are used in the notebook:
# ```text
# OSError: Can't find this filename C:\users\Brian\s\life\wodger.spg
# ```
# In this respect, a good practice consists in using relative pathnames in scripts and notebooks.
# Fortunately, SpectroChemPy readers use relative paths. If the given path is not absolute, then SpectroChemPy will
# search in the current directory. Hence, the opening of the `spg` file from scripts in `welease.ipynb` can be made
# by the command:
# ```ipython3
# X = scp.read_omnic('Life/wodger.spg')
# ```
# or:
# ```ipython3
# X = scp.read_omnic('wodger.spg', directory='Life')
# ```
#
# ### Good practice: use `os` or `pathlib` modules
#
# In python, working with pathnames is classically done with dedicated modules such as `os` or `pathlib` python modules.
# With `os` we mention the following methods that can be particularly useful:
#
# ```ipython3
# import os
# os.getcwd()              # returns the absolute path of the current working directory preferences.datadir
# os.path.expanduser("~")  # returns the home directory of the user
# os.path.join('path1','path2','path3', ...)   # intelligently concatenates path components
#                                              # using the system separator (`/`or `\\`)
# ```
#
# Using `Pathlib` is even simpler:
# ```ipython3
# from pathlib import Path
# Path.cwd()               # returns the absolute path of the current working directory
# Path.home()              # returns the home directory of the user
# Path('path1') / 'path2' / 'path3' / '...'   # intelligently concatenates path components
# ```
#
#  The interested readers will find more details on the use of these modules here:
# - [os - Miscellaneous operating system interfaces](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
# - [pathlib â€” Object-oriented filesystem paths](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
#
# ## Another default search directory: `datadir`
#
# Spectrochempy also comes with the definition of a second default directory path where to look at the data:
# the `datadir` directory. It is defined in the variable `preferences.datadir` which is imported at the same
# time as spectrochempy. By default, `datadir` points in the 'scp_data\testdata' folder of SpectroChemPy:

# %%

DATADIR = scp.preferences.datadir
DATADIR

# %% [markdown]
# DATADIR is already a pathlib object and so can be used easily

# %%

X = scp.read_omnic(DATADIR / "wodger.spg")

# %% [markdown]
# It can be set to another pathname *permanently* (i.e., even after computer restart) by a new assignment:
#
# ```ipython3
# scp.preferences.datadir = 'C:/users/Brian/s/Life'
# ```
#
# This will change the default value in the SCPy preference file located in the hidden folder
# `.spectrochempy/` at the root of the user home directory.
#
# Finally, by default, the import functions used in Sepctrochempy will search the data files using this order of
# precedence:
#
#    1. try absolute path
#    2. try in current working directory
#    3. try in `datadir`
#    4. if none of these works: generate an OSError (file or directory not found)
#

# %% [markdown]
# ## File selector widget

# %% [markdown]
# A widget is provided to help with the selection of file names or directory.
#

# %%

datadir = scp.preferences.datadir
fs = scp.FileSelector(path=datadir, filters=["spg", "spa"])
fs

# %% [markdown]
# After validation of the selection, one can read the path and name of the selected files.

# %%

fs.value, fs.path, fs.fullpath
