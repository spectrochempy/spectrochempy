# # API Configuration

# %% [markdown]
# Many options of the API can be set up.
# Let's first import it in the usual way:

# %%
import spectrochempy as scp

# %% [markdown]
# ## General information
# General information on the API can be obtained the following variables:

# %%
print(f"   copyright : {scp.copyright}")
print(f"     version : {scp.version}")
print(f"     release : {scp.release}")
print(f"     license : {scp.license}")
print(f"         url : {scp.url}")
print(f"release_date : {scp.release_date}")
print(f"     authors : {scp.authors}")
print(f"contributors : {scp.contributors}")
print(f" description : {scp.description}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Loglevel
# During the execution, the API can display, besides the expected output, various messages categorized according
# to their criticality:
#
# | Loglevel / criticality | use |
# | --- | --- |
# | `DEBUG` / `10` | diagnose problems on the running process or help developers |
# | `INFO`  / `20` | general information on the running process |
# | `WARNING` / `30` (default) | a condition might cause a problem WRT expected behaviour |
# | `ERROR`   / `40` | wrong argument/commands or bug |
# | `CRITICAL` / `50` | could lead to a system crash |
#
#  Not all this information is always necessary and the level of information displayed by SpectroChemPy can be
#  tuned using the command `scp.set_loglevel()` with the rule that only information having a
#  criticality larger than that passed to the `set_loglevel()` function will be shown.
#
#  For instance, the `DEBUG` level can be triggered by using one of the three equivalent instructions
# ```python
# scp.set_loglevel('DEBUG')
# scp.set_loglevel(scp.DEBUG)
# scp.set_loglevel(10)
# ```
# The current loglevel can be obtained with the `scp.get_loglevel()` function.
#
# The following instruction prints the current loglevel
# %%
print(f"Default: {scp.get_loglevel()}")  # print the current loglevel

# %% [markdown]
# It yields `30` the numerical value corresponding to the `WARNING` level. Now, the next instruction
# lowers the loglevel to `ÃŒNFO`:
# %%
scp.set_loglevel(scp.INFO)  # set loglevel to 'INFO'


# %% [markdown]
# We see that the API then delivers the INFO message: `changed default log_level to INFO`.

# %% [markdown]
# And  finally, the next instructions reset the loglevel to `WARNING` level (default), and print it.
# As seen below, no message `changed default log_level to ...` is delivered

# %%
scp.set_loglevel("WARNING")  # reset to default
print(f"New loglevel: {scp.get_loglevel()}")

# %% [markdown]
# It is also possible to issue such messages in scripts. In the cell below, we set the loglevel to `INFO` and try to
# print two types of messages:

# %%
scp.set_loglevel("INFO")
scp.info_("this is an info message!")
scp.debug_("this is a debug message!")

# %% [markdown]
# As expected, only the info message was displayed.
#
# If we change the loglevel to ``DEBUG``, then the two messages will be printed:

# %%
scp.set_loglevel(scp.DEBUG)
scp.info_("this is an info message!")
scp.debug_("this is a debug message!")

# %% [markdown]
# Finally, we come back to the standard level of message for the rest of the Tutorial -- in this case neither `DEBUG`
# nor `INFO` messages will be printed.

# %%
scp.set_loglevel(scp.WARNING)

scp.info_("this is an info message!")
scp.debug_("this is a debug message!")

# %% [markdown]
#
# ### Error handling
# If something goes wrong with during a cell execution,  a ``traceback`` is displayed.
#
# For instance, the object or method ``toto`` does not exist in the API, so an error (`ImportError`) is generated
# when trying to import this from the API.
#
# Here we catch the error with a conventional `try-except` structure

# %%
try:
    from spectrochempy import toto
except ImportError as e:
    scp.error_("OOPS, THAT'S AN IMPORT ERROR! : %s" % e)

# %% [markdown]
# The error will stop the execution if not caught.
#
# This is a basic behavior of python : one way to avoid stopping the execution without displaying a message is :

# %%
try:
    from spectrochempy import toto  # noqa: F811, F401
except Exception:
    pass
