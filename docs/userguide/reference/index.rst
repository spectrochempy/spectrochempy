####################
Public API reference
####################

The |scpy| API publicly exposes many objects and functions.
They are listed below exhaustively.
What is not listed here is reserved for developers and should not normally be necessary for normal use of |scpy|.

.. contents:: Table of Contents

****************
Loading the API
****************

To use the API, you must import it using one of the following syntax:

.. ipython:: python

    import spectrochempy as scp  # Recommended!
    nd = scp.NDDataset()

.. ipython:: python

    from spectrochempy import *
    nd = NDDataset()

With the second syntax, as often in python, the access to objects/functions can be greatly simplified. For example,
we can use `NDDataset` without a prefix instead of `scp.NDDataset` which is the first syntax) but there is always a risk
of overwriting some variables or functions already present in the namespace. Therefore, the first syntax is generally
highly recommended.


*********************
The NDDataset Object
*********************

The NDDataset is the main object use by |scpy|.

Like numpy ndarrays, NDDataset have the capability to be sliced, sorted and subject to mathematical operations.

But, in addition, NDDataset may have units, can be masked and each dimension can also have coordinated with units.
This make NDDataset aware of unit compatibility, *e.g.,*, for binary operation such as additions or subtraction or
during the application of mathematical operations. In addition or in replacement of numerical data for coordinates,
NDDataset can also have labeled coordinates where labels can be different kinds of objects (strings, datetime, numpy
nd.ndarray or other NDDatasets, etc...).

This offers a lot of flexibility in using NDDatasets that, we hope, will be useful for applications. See the
**Tutorials** for more information about such possible applications.

***************************
Coordinates-related objects
***************************

|NDDataset| in |scpy| in contrast to numpy nd-arrays can have coordinates for each dimension.
The individual coordinates are represented by a specific object: |Coord|.
All coordinates of a |NDDataset| are grouped in a particular object: |CoordSet|.

    LinearCoord
    CoordSet


*******************
Creating NDDataset
*******************

A |NDDataset| can be created using the |NDDataset| class constructor, for instance here we create a dataset from a
random two-dimensional array:

.. ipython:: python

    import numpy as np
    X = np.random.random((4,4))
    nd = NDDataset(X)

The above code in |scpy| can be simplified using the ``random`` creation method:

.. ipython:: python

    X = NDDataset.random((4,4))


(see the :ref:`userguide` for a large set of examples on how to use this constructor.)

Many SpectroChemPy methods mimics numpy equivalent, but output a NDDataset object.
