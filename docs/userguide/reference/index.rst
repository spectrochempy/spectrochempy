API reference

****************
Loading the API
****************

The |scpy| API exposes many objects and functions.

To use the API, you must import it using one of the following syntax:

.. ipython:: python

    import spectrochempy as scp
    nd = scp.NDDataset()

.. ipython:: python

    from spectrochempy import *
    nd = NDDataset()

With the second syntax, as often in python, the access to objects/functions
can be greatly simplified. For example, we can use "NDDataset" without a prefix
instead of `scp.NDDataset` which is the first syntax) but there is always a risk
of overwriting some variables or functions already present in the namespace.
Therefore, the first syntax is generally highly recommended.


*********************
The NDDataset object
*********************

The NDDataset is the main object use by |scpy|.

Like numpy ndarrays, NDDataset have the capability to be sliced,
sorted and subject to mathematical operations.

But, in addition, NDDataset may have units, can be masked and each
dimensions can have coordinates also with units. This make NDDataset
aware of unit compatibility, *e.g.*, for binary operation such as
additions or subtraction or during the application of mathematical
operations. In addition or in replacement of numerical data for
coordinates, NDDataset can also have labeled coordinates where labels
can be different kind of objects (strings, datetime, numpy nd.ndarray
or othe NDDatasets, etc...).

This offers a lot of flexibility in using NDDatasets that, we hope,
will be useful for applications. See the **Tutorials** for more
information about such possible applications.

**SpectroChemPy** provides another kind of data structure,
aggregating several datasets: **NDPanel**: See

    NDDataset


Coordinates related objects
---------------------------

NDDataset in SpectroChemPy in contrast to numpy nd-arrays can have coordinates for each dimension.
The individual coordinates are represented by a specific object: Coord.
All coordinates of an NDDataset are grouped in a particular object: CoordSet.
Finally, a range of coordinates can be represented by the object: CoordRange.

Creating NDDataset
-------------------

A NDDataset can be created using the NDDataset class constructor, for instance here we create a dataset from a random
two dimensional array:

.. ipython:: python

    import numpy as np
    X = np.random.random((4,4))
    nd = NDDataset(X)


(see the User Guide for examples on how to use this constructor.)
