Developper's guide

General principles
==================
The instructions below are a general guide, we do our best to follow it, and if you wish to contribute we encourage you
to follow it as well. But you don't have to follow them to the letter: you can also give us your opinion on it and ask
for changes. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. Don't be afraid that your code is not correct or pretty.
We can discuss it by opening an issue (see :ref:`contributing.bug_reports`).

How to contribute?
==================
Every SpectroChemPy user can make a useful contribution to this project.

There are several ways to do so, depending on your programming knowledge and/or availability :

* report bugs
* request improvements or new features

These are minimal contributions, but they would help us a lot to maintain a functional application.
(see :ref:`contributing.bug_reports`).

In this guide, we will talk about more advanced topics concerning contributions to documentation and to the code. We
will also look strategy of deployement used by spectrochempy?
