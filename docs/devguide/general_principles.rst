General Principles
===================

The instructions below are a general guide. We do our best to follow this guide, and if you wish to contribute we encourage you to follow it as well. But you don't have to follow everything to the letter: Any kind of contribution is welcome!

In this guide, we will talk about some basic but very useful contributions such as bug reports our feature requests, and of some more advanced topics concerning contributions to documentation and to the code base.

Note that the content of this guide has been partly inspired by the `pandas developer guide <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/contributing.html>`__).
