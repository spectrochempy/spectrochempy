What is |scpy|?
=================

|scpy| is a framework for processing, analyzing and modeling **Spectro**\ scopic data for **Chem**\ istry with **Py**\ thon.
It is a cross platform software, running on Linux, Windows or OS X.

Among its major features:

#.  A ``NDDataset`` object embedding array of data with labeled axes and metadata.
#.  A ``Project`` manager to work on multiple ``NDDataset`` simultaneously.
#.  Physical ``Units`` for ``NDDataset``.
#.  Mathematical operations over ``NDDataset`` such addition, multiplication and many more ...
#.  Import functions to read data from experiments or modeling programs ...
#.  Display functions such as ``plot`` for 1D or nD datasets ...
#.  Export functions to *csv*, *xls* formats ...
#.  Preprocessing functions such as baseline correction, automatic subtraction and many more ...
#.  Fitting capabilities for single or multiple datasets ...
#.  Exploratory analysis such as ``SVD``, ``PCA``, ``MCR_ALS``, ``EFA`` ...
