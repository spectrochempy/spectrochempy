What is |scpy|?
=================

|scpy| is a framework for processing, analyzing and modeling **Spectro**\ scopic
data for **Chem**\ istry with **Py**\ thon. It is a cross platform software,
running on Linux, Windows or OS X.

#.  A ``NDDataset`` object embedding array of data with labeled axes and
    metadata.
#.  A ``Project`` manager to work on multiple ``NDDataset`` simultaneously.
#.  Physical ``Units`` and ``Uncertainty`` for ``NDDataset``.
#.  Mathematical operations over ``NDDataset`` such addition,
    multiplication and many more ...
#.  Import functions to read data from experiments or modeling programs ...
#.  Display functions such as ``plot`` for 1D or nD datasets ...
#.  Export functions to **csv**, **xls** formats ...
#.  Preprocessing functions such as baseline correction, automatic
    subtraction and many more ...
#.  Fitting capabilities for single or multiple datasets ...
#.  Exploratory analysis such as ``SVD``, ``PCA``, ``MCR_ALS``, ``EFA`` ...
