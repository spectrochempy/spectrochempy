    "The slicing of a list or an array means taking elements from a given index\n",
    "(or set of indexes) to another index (or set of indexes).\n",
    "Slicing is specified using the colon operator `:` with a `from` and `to` index\n",
    "before and after the first column, and a `step` after the second column.\n",
    "Hence, a slice of the object `X` will be set as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`X[from:to:step]`\n",
    "\n",
    "and will extend from the ‘from’ index, ends one item before the ‘to’ index\n",
    "and with an increment of `step`between each index. When not given the default\n",
    "values are respectively 0 (i.e. starts at the 1st index),\n",
