Reading SPC format files
===========================
This example shows reading of 'Galactic Industriesâ€™ SPC data file format. (``.spc`` format).

"""

# %%
# First we need to import the spectrochempy API package
import spectrochempy as scp

# %%
# The SPC format is a proprietary format from Galactic Industries. It is used for
# storing spectroscopic data. The SPC format is a binary file format that can store
# multiple spectra in a single file. The SPC format is widely used in the field of
# spectroscopy and is supported by many spectroscopic software packages.

# %%
# Reading single file
ex1 = scp.read_spc("galacticdata/BENZENE.SPC")
ex1.plot()
ex1

# %%
# reading SPC file with multiple subfiles with same x coordinates (they are merged by default)
ex2 = scp.read_spc("galacticdata/CONTOUR.SPC")
ex2.plot()
ex2
# %%
# Reading SPC file with multiple subfiles with different x coordinates (they are not merged)
ex3 = scp.read_spc("galacticdata/DRUG_SAMPLE_PEAKS.SPC")
for nd in ex3:
    nd.plot_bar(width=0.1, clear=False)
ex3

# This ends the example ! The following line can be uncommented if no plot shows when
# running the .py script with python

# scp.show()
