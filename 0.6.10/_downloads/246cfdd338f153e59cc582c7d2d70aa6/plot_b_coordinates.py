NDDataset coordinates example
=============================

In this example, we show how coordinates can be used in SpectroChemPy

# %%
import spectrochempy as scp

# %%
# Uploading a dataset
# -------------------
X = scp.read("irdata/CO@Mo_Al2O3.SPG")

# %%
# `X` has two coordinates:
# * `wavenumbers` named "x"
# * and `timestamps` (*i.e.,* the time of recording) named "y".
print(X.coordset)

# %%
# To display them individually use the `x` and `y` attributes of
# the dataset `X`:

X.x

# %%
#

X.y

# %%
# Setting new coordinates
# -----------------------
#
# In this example, each experiment have a timestamp corresponds to the time
# when a given pressure of CO in the infrared cell was set.
#
# Hence, it would be interesting to replace the "useless" timestamps (`y` )
# by a pressure coordinates:

pressures = [
    0.00300,
    0.00400,
    0.00900,
    0.01400,
    0.02100,
    0.02600,
    0.03600,
    0.05100,
    0.09300,
    0.15000,
    0.20300,
    0.30000,
    0.40400,
    0.50300,
    0.60200,
    0.70200,
    0.80100,
    0.90500,
    1.00400,
]

# %%
# 1. A first way to do this is to replace the time coordinates by the pressure
#    coordinate

# %%
# *(we first make a copy of the time coordinates for later use the original will
# be destroyed by the following operation)*

c_times = X.y.copy()

# %%
# Now we perform the replacement with this new coordinate:

c_pressures = scp.Coord(pressures, title="pressure", units="torr")
X.y = c_pressures
print(X.y)

# %%
# 2. A second way is to affect several coordinates to the corresponding dimension.
#    To do this, the simplest is to affect a list of coordinates instead of a single one:

X.y = [c_times, c_pressures]
print(X.y)

# %%
# By default, the current coordinate is the first one (here `c_times` ).
# For example, it will be used for plotting:

prefs = X.preferences
prefs.figure.figsize = (7, 3)
_ = X.plot(colorbar=True)
_ = X.plot_map(colorbar=True)

# %%
# To seamlessly work with the second coordinates (pressures),
# we can change the default coordinate:

X.y.select(2)  # to select coordinate `_2`
X.y.default

# %%
# Let's now plot the spectral range of interest. The default coordinate is now used:
X_ = X[:, 2250.0:1950.0]
print(X_.y.default)
_ = X_.plot()
_ = X_.plot_map()

# %%
# The same can be done for the x coordinates.
#
# Let's take for instance row with index 10 of the previous dataset

row10 = X_[10].squeeze()
row10.plot()
print(row10.coordset)

# %%
# Now we wants to add a coordinate with the wavelength instead of wavenumber.

c_wavenumber = row10.x.copy()
c_wavelength = row10.x.to("nanometer")
print(c_wavenumber, c_wavelength)
row10.x = [c_wavenumber, c_wavelength]
row10.x.select(2)
_ = row10.plot()

# %%
# This ends the example ! The following line can be uncommented if no plot shows when
# running the .py script with python

# scp.show()
