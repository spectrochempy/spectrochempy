Removing cosmic ray spikes from a Raman spectrum
=================================================

In this example, we use the `despike` method to remove the noise from a Raman
spectrum.

import spectrochempy as scp

# Load the data

# Keep only one spectrum in this series

# Now let's use the `~spectrochempy.despike` method.
# Only two parameters needs to be tuned: the `size` of the filter
# (actually a Savitsky-Golay filter of order 2), and `delta`, the threshold for the
# detection of spikes (outliers).
# A spike is detected if its value is greater than `delta` times the standard deviation
# of the difference between the original and the smoothed data.

X2 = scp.despike(X1, size=11, delta=5)
_ = X1.plot()
_ = X2.plot(clear=False, ls="-", c="r")

# %%
# Getting the desired results require the tuning of size and delta parameters.
# And sometimes may need to repeat the procedure on a previously filtered spectra.
#
# For example, if size or delta are badly chosen, valid peaks could be removed.
# So careful inspection of the results is crucial.

X3 = scp.despike(X1, size=21, delta=2)
_ = X1.plot()
_ = X3.plot(clear=False, ls="-", c="r")
