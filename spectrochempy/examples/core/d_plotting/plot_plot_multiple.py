"""
Using `plot_multiple` to plot several datasets on the same figure
=================================================================
In this example, we will display several Raman datasets on the same figure
using the `plot_multiple` method. Several options are available to customize
the display.
"""
# %%
# Import spectrochempy as usual
import spectrochempy as scp

# %%
# Load the data (here 2D spectrum made from a list of 1D spectra):
B1 = scp.read("ramandata/labspec/serie190214-1.txt")

# %%
# First we show the basic plot (note here the use of the `cmap=None` option to
# display the spectra with rotating colors. cmap can be of course set to any other
# available matplotlib colormap. The second parameter `lw` is used to set the line
# width. In addition, we fix the figsize to have a better view of the spectra.
prefs = B1.preferences
prefs.figure.figsize = (8, 4)
_ = B1.plot(cmap=None, lw=1)

# %%
# We will limit the x range to the region of interest
# note the float number to specify that we use coordinates and not indices
B2 = B1[:, 60.0:]

# %%
# As there is obviously a drift in these spectra, we will use detrend to remove it.
B3 = scp.detrend(B2)
_ = B3.plot(cmap=None)

# %%
# To demonstrate the use of `plot_multiple` we will take only a few spectra.
# For instance the 5 first spectra:
B4 = B3[:5]

# %%
# plot it to see what we have selected
B4.plot(cmap=None)

# %%
# Now we will use `plot_multiple` to plot all the spectra of the dataset B4.
# we need to use `offset` to separate the traces and we set some labels to identify
# these traces on the final plot. different colors and line width are also used.
# Note that we can use the `legend` option to place the legend at the best location.
# We can also use the `shift` option to shift the traces vertically.
datasets = list(B4)
_ = scp.plot_multiple(
    datasets,
    method="pen",
    legend="best",
    labels=["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"],
    color=["black", "red", "green", "blue", "violet"],
    lw=[1, 2.5, 1, 1, 1],  # line width (we use here different values)
    ls="-",  # solid line style
    shift=1000,  # vertical shift
)

# This ends the example ! The following line can be uncommented if no plot shows when
# running the .py script with python
