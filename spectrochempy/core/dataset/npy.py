def dot(a, b, strict=True, out=None):
    """
    Return the dot product of two NDDatasets.

    This function is the equivalent of `numpy.dot` that takes NDDataset as
    input

    .. note::
      Works only with 2-D arrays at the moment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : masked_array_like
        Inputs arrays.
    strict : bool, optional
        Whether masked data are propagated (True) or set to 0 (False) for
        the computation. Default is False.  Propagating the mask means that
        if a masked value appears in a row or column, the whole row or
        column is considered masked.
    out : masked_array, optional
        Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
        if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
        C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
        for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
        conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
        to be flexible.
