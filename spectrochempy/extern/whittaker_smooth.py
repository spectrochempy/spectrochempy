WHITTAKER-EILERS SMOOTHER in Python 3 using numpy and scipy

based on the work by Eilers [1].
    [1] P. H. C. Eilers, "A perfect smoother",
        Anal. Chem. 2003, (75), 3631-3636
coded by M. H. V. Werts (CNRS, France)
tested on Anaconda 64-bit (Python 3.6.4, numpy 1.14.0, scipy 1.0.0)

Warm thanks go to Simon Bordeyne who pioneered a first (non-sparse) version
of the smoother in Python.

    Implementation of the Whittaker smoothing algorithm,

    [1] P. H. C. Eilers, "A perfect smoother", Anal. Chem. 2003, (75), 3631-3636

    The larger 'lmbd', the smoother the data.
    For smoothing of a complete data series, sampled at equal intervals

    This implementation uses sparse matrices enabling high-speed processing
    of large input vectors

    ---------

    Arguments :

    y       : vector containing raw data
    lmbd    : parameter for the smoothing algorithm (roughness penalty)
    d       : order of the smoothing

    ---------

    Returns :

    z       : vector of the smoothed data.
