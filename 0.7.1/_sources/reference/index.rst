####################
Public API reference
####################

The `SpectroChemPy` :term:`API` publicly exposes many objects and functions.
They are listed below exhaustively.
What is not listed here is reserved for developers and should not normally be necessary for normal use of `SpectroChemPy` .

.. contents:: Table of Contents

***************
Loading the API
***************

To use the API, you must import it using one of the following syntax:

.. ipython:: python

    import spectrochempy as scp  # Recommended!
    nd = scp.NDDataset()

.. ipython:: python

    from spectrochempy import *  # strongly discouraged
    nd = NDDataset()

With the second syntax, as often in python, the access to objects/functions can be greatly simplified. For example,
we can use `NDDataset` without a prefix instead of `scp.NDDataset` which is the first syntax) but there is always a risk
of overwriting some variables or functions already present in the namespace. Therefore, the first syntax is generally
highly recommended.

However instead of the second syntax, one can always use the following way to import objects or functions:

.. ipython:: python

    from spectrochempy import NDDataset
    nd = NDDataset()


********************
The NDDataset Object
********************

The `NDDataset` is the main object use by `SpectroChemPy` .

Like `numpy.ndarray`\ s, `NDDataset` have the capability to be sliced, sorted and subject to mathematical operations.

But, in addition, `NDDataset` may have units, can be masked and each dimension can also have coordinated with units.
This make `NDDataset` aware of unit compatibility, *e.g.,*, for binary operation such as additions or subtraction or
during the application of mathematical operations. In addition or in replacement of numerical data for coordinates,
NDDataset can also have labeled coordinates where labels can be different kinds of objects (strings, datetime, numpy
nd.ndarray or other NDDatasets, etc...).

This offers a lot of flexibility in using NDDatasets that, we hope, will be useful for applications. See the
:ref:`userguide` for more information about such possible applications.

Coordinates-related objects
===========================

`NDDataset` in `SpectroChemPy` in contrast to numpy nd-arrays can have coordinates for each dimension.
The individual coordinates are represented by a specific object: `Coord`.
All coordinates of a `NDDataset` are grouped in a particular object: `CoordSet`.

******************
Creating NDDataset
******************

A `NDDataset` can be created using the `NDDataset` class constructor, for instance here we create a dataset from a
`~numpy.random.random` two-dimensional array:

.. ipython:: python

    import numpy as np
    X = np.random.random((4,4))
    nd = NDDataset(X)

The above code in `SpectroChemPy` can be simplified using the `random` creation method:

.. ipython:: python

    X = NDDataset.random((4,4))


(see the :ref:`userguide` for a large set of examples on how to use this constructor.)

Many SpectroChemPy methods mimics `numpy` equivalent, but output a `NDDataset` object.
