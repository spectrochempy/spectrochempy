    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "MCR-ALS (standing for Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares) is a\n",
    "popular method for resolving a set (or several sets) of spectra $X$ of an evolving\n",
    "mixture (or a set of mixtures) into the spectra $S^t$ of 'pure'\n",
    "species and their concentration profiles $C$. In terms of matrix equation:\n",

    "The ALS algorithm allows applying soft or hard constraints (e.g., non negativity,\n",
