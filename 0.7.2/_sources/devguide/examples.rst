Adding your examples to the gallery
------------------------------------

If you have any nice examples to add to the SpectroChemPy gallery, they are more than welcome. They will allow other users to see the API in operation.

There are two ways to do this:

* Use the discussion forums and attach your files, which we will take into account
  after revisions, mentioning of course the origin and the possible copyright.

* Create a pull request: For this operation, if you are a newcomer with the ``git`` version system,
  please refer to the :ref:`develguide`  section .
