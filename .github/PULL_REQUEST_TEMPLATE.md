**Checklist for a good PR**:

- [ ] Close the #xxxx (optional)
- [ ] Tests have been added (mostly required)
- [ ] `.ci/templates/dependencies.tmpl`file has been updated with new dependencies
- [ ] User-visible changes (including notable bug fixes) have been documented in `docs/whatsnew/changelog.rst`.
- [ ] You  have run: `python .ci/update_version_and_release_notes.py` after each changes in `docs/whatsnew/changelog.rst`.
- [ ] The new API methods have been included in a section of `docs/userguide/reference/index.rst`.
- [ ] If you are a new contributor, you have added your name (affiliation and ORCID
      if you have one) in the .zenodo.json in the field contributors field. *Be careful
      not to break the json format (check the content of the file with the
      [JSON Validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/))*
