# Refactored Plotting Test Suite
# ===================================
#
# This is a clean, modern test suite for SpectroChemPy plotting functionality.
# Designed to be robust, CI-friendly, and explicit about test intent.
#
# Structure:
# - Clear test organization by plotting type
# - Proper pytest fixtures for state isolation
# - Explicit handling of known limitations (xfail)
# - Efficient, deterministic tests suitable for CI/nightly builds
