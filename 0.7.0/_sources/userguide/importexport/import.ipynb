    "notebooks.\n",

    "absolute, then SpectroChemPy will search in the current directory. Hence, the opening\n",

    "### Good practice: use `os` or `pathlib` modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, working with pathnames is classically done with dedicated modules such as\n",

    "os.path.expanduser(\"~\")  # returns the home directory of the user\n",

    "                         # using the system separator (`/` or `\\\\` )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Pathlib` is even simpler:\n",

    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "Path.cwd()               # returns the absolute path of the current working directory\n",
    "Path.home()              # returns the home directory of the user\n",
